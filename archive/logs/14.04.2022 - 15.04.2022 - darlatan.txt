14.4.2022, 13:30:38 - toasterbirb: She challenged everyone in this room to doxx her. I didn't see the original challenge, but she reminded us about it at some point
14.4.2022, 13:30:53 - toasterbirb: I guess she wanted to prove her points
14.4.2022, 13:31:42 - toasterbirb: As far as I know, no one managed to do it
14.4.2022, 14:45:47 - darlatan: I think it is legit but people here say only Babba27 could tell
14.4.2022, 14:53:31 - darlatan: So when was the last time Babba27 was online?
14.4.2022, 15:19:37 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "So when was the last time Babba2..."> She usually sleep at this time, you will probably find her online in like 5-6 hours i believe
14.4.2022, 15:20:09 - toasterbirb: <del>5 hours according to element</del>
nvm. not sure
14.4.2022, 15:21:06 - darlatan: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "5 hours according to element"> how do you see that?
14.4.2022, 15:21:31 - darlatan: oh okay
14.4.2022, 15:22:01 - toasterbirb: You can browse the room members in Element and it shows the offline timer
14.4.2022, 15:22:11 - darlatan: what if the gist is legit? should we assume the worst?
14.4.2022, 15:22:11 - toasterbirb: just need to find the correct account from the list of 680 people...
14.4.2022, 15:23:17 - darlatan: is there no backstory at all? from my pov, she just vanished almost instantly from every platform except github 
14.4.2022, 15:23:51 - toasterbirb: Quite difficult to say, but if she really lived in Kyiv Ukraine, pretty much everything is possible
14.4.2022, 15:24:40 - darlatan: This is her keyoxide https://keyoxide.org/eb16b6ab4ab7ba61f33e2dfd0051e9a589dab601
14.4.2022, 15:24:53 - toasterbirb: I want to just think that her internet connection was cut and the switch triggered or something. There has been notes recently about attacks on civillians though...
14.4.2022, 15:25:47 - darlatan: Someone told me in a DM that was fleeing Kyiv and that was the last news she posted 
14.4.2022, 15:28:18 - toasterbirb hat ein Bild gesendet. (Medien ausgelassen)
14.4.2022, 15:28:20 - toasterbirb hat ein Bild gesendet. (Medien ausgelassen)
14.4.2022, 15:28:29 - toasterbirb: Welp, the keys seem to match at least
14.4.2022, 15:29:01 - toasterbirb: I haven't really followed the news too much recently and don't really know how Kyiv is doing
14.4.2022, 15:31:04 - toasterbirb: It could very well be possible that she has lost access to the internet. Then again, it really isn't clear how much delay was there in the dead man's switch timer
14.4.2022, 15:32:14 - @allures:matrix.org: Well babba probably knows all the thruth but she will not tell us, she knows more than us 
14.4.2022, 15:32:28 - @allures:matrix.org: Not probably, i'm sure 
14.4.2022, 15:33:49 - darlatan: then there is this https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonypla

14.4.2022, 15:37:14 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "Why not? We could help"> There is a big secret

14.4.2022, 15:37:56 - @allures:matrix.org: I dont think that 
14.4.2022, 15:37:58 - darlatan: I had a few DMs with her on Twitter 
14.4.2022, 15:38:49 - darlatan: I even donated some XMR to her
14.4.2022, 15:38:52 - @allures:matrix.org: Id think that will help,  she was a paranoid,  that explain few things (babba sayed that ) 
14.4.2022, 15:39:09 - @allures:matrix.org: Babba is lying 
14.4.2022, 15:39:16 - @allures:matrix.org: And anonypla too
14.4.2022, 15:39:29 - @allures:matrix.org: Babba slipt few things out 
14.4.2022, 15:39:33 - darlatan: lying? you mean hiding their real identity?
14.4.2022, 15:39:42 - @allures:matrix.org: About everything 
14.4.2022, 15:39:59 - darlatan: everything?
14.4.2022, 15:40:17 - toasterbirb: Just don't turn this into a conspiracy theory
14.4.2022, 15:40:05 - darlatan: you think the whole thing is a hoax?
14.4.2022, 15:40:09 - darlatan: seriously?
14.4.2022, 15:40:21 - neo_sodom: It's just an identity we don't know
14.4.2022, 15:40:23 - darlatan: someone would write a 160 pages guide and then just destroy it?
14.4.2022, 15:40:33 - darlatan: are you kidding?
14.4.2022, 15:40:46 - darlatan: do you have any idea how much work she put into that thing?
14.4.2022, 15:40:53 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "someone would write a 160 pages ..."> You're week with you're thinking, i like anony bc of her power of thinking xD 
14.4.2022, 15:40:59 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "do you have any idea how much wo..."> Yes
14.4.2022, 15:41:04 - @allures:matrix.org: She wasnt destroyed 
14.4.2022, 15:41:25 - darlatan: Yes because she made archive.org copies at each release
14.4.2022, 15:41:49 - @allures:matrix.org: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "Just don't turn this into a cons..."> This is the thrut, babba is lying, something smell bad 
14.4.2022, 15:42:19 - toasterbirb: <@darlatan:matrix.org "someone would write a 160 pages ..."> Destroy what? Can you tell me what has been destroyed?
14.4.2022, 15:41:56 - darlatan: This guide is pure gold 
14.4.2022, 15:41:57 - @allures:matrix.org: xD
14.4.2022, 15:42:12 - darlatan: And btw we should definitely tell Ukrainians to use Briar
14.4.2022, 15:42:14 - @allures:matrix.org: I'm 100% sure babba is lying and she knows everything 
14.4.2022, 15:42:15 - darlatan: actively
14.4.2022, 15:42:22 - @allures:matrix.org: Yeah true

14.4.2022, 15:43:43 - darlatan: all that remains is that github account, that hackernews account and that keybase account
14.4.2022, 15:45:45 - toasterbirb: <@darlatan:matrix.org "all her accounts, the website, t..."> You can click the link in the room description, grab a PDF and continue with your day. I don't see any issues with that
14.4.2022, 15:46:46 - toasterbirb: Also, what would you do to your own accounts if you were in the risk of being captured
14.4.2022, 15:47:04 - darlatan: because I care for good people
14.4.2022, 15:47:26 - toasterbirb: Running some website is the last thing in your mind when someone is knocking to your door with a glock
14.4.2022, 15:47:26 - darlatan: obviously, you don't 
14.4.2022, 15:48:26 - @allures:matrix.org: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "Can you elaborate any further"> Yes i can, but i will not do that, i let you guys think and see the thruth with you're eyes,  now that we talked that she might preoare now xD 
14.4.2022, 15:48:29 - toasterbirb: I'm not undermining her work. Don't get me wrong. I just can't understand the brewing conspiracy theories recently in this room that make the situation look like a fucking TV drama
14.4.2022, 15:48:31 - @allures:matrix.org: Soo good luck
14.4.2022, 15:49:36 - toasterbirb: Well, that statement was bunch of air if something
14.4.2022, 15:50:04 - @allures:matrix.org: I meant babba not anonypla xD 
14.4.2022, 15:50:19 - @allures:matrix.org: Is not a tv drama , the reason is simple 
14.4.2022, 15:50:25 - @allures:matrix.org: Just bad hide 
14.4.2022, 15:51:14 - darlatan: look look look 
14.4.2022, 15:51:41 - darlatan: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonypla
14.4.2022, 15:51:55 - darlatan: it was updated just now 
14.4.2022, 15:52:09 - darlatan: like 5 mins ago it wasn't there
14.4.2022, 15:52:11 - darlatan: same message
14.4.2022, 15:53:00 - neo_sodom: That is true. It was not there the last time I checked. But as it said, it was probably automated
14.4.2022, 15:53:19 - darlatan: she has a server somewhere hidden running scripts trying to post messages on all her accounts
14.4.2022, 15:53:58 - toasterbirb: probably a github action or something with a timer 
14.4.2022, 15:53:46 - darlatan: the exact same message
14.4.2022, 15:54:05 - neo_sodom: <@darlatan:matrix.org "she has a server somewhere hidde..."> And that proves what?
14.4.2022, 15:54:41 - darlatan: mmmmmh
14.4.2022, 15:55:17 - neo_sodom: Except what toaster wrote
14.4.2022, 15:55:25 - darlatan: I think it's legit because I see absolutely no reason to doubt it. I wouldn't write 160 pages and then just trash it all away
14.4.2022, 15:55:44 - toasterbirb: In github you can create actions in a repo for free that run repeatedly with a cron job. She probably has it check for website visits and if there is none, the action will do something more than just sleep
14.4.2022, 15:56:23 - toasterbirb: Just jam bunch of API keys with no expiration date there and you have a script that can post stuff to multiple platforms
14.4.2022, 15:56:44 - neo_sodom: Its not trashed away since there is already a new maintained guide. It was just the easiest method to vanish without needing to elaborate further and justify herself
14.4.2022, 15:57:54 - toasterbirb: This just proves the point that guides like this need many more backups than just the ones made by the original creator
14.4.2022, 16:03:32 - skypass hat den Raum betreten

14.4.2022, 16:07:13 - toasterbirb: Do you see my edit?
14.4.2022, 16:07:20 - toasterbirb: The page was blank for a while
14.4.2022, 16:07:25 - darlatan: meh ... makes no sense to me 
14.4.2022, 16:08:07 - darlatan: her vanishing coincidentally happened exactly when the Russians closed in on Kyiv 
14.4.2022, 16:08:44 - darlatan: my take? she's an activisit
14.4.2022, 16:08:45 - neo_sodom: Coincidentally ... because it was planned
14.4.2022, 16:08:47 - darlatan: activist
14.4.2022, 16:08:58 - darlatan: and she got pwned by the Russians
14.4.2022, 16:09:09 - neo_sodom: Allegedly
14.4.2022, 16:09:14 - darlatan: yeah
14.4.2022, 16:09:34 - darlatan: but this message contain some information that maybe could prove it's legit to some people in here
14.4.2022, 16:09:59 - darlatan: I guess we need to wait for Babba27
14.4.2022, 16:11:16 - darlatan: Things she only said prior to some specific people

14.4.2022, 16:12:57 - darlatan: She has good music taste
14.4.2022, 16:13:59 - darlatan: <@allures:matrix.org "She will not cooperate :))))"> We'll see
14.4.2022, 16:14:23 - darlatan: All I want to know is if the gist is legit or not
14.4.2022, 16:14:43 - darlatan: if it is ... I'll send friends in Romania and Poland to look for her at the camps at the border 
14.4.2022, 16:14:47 - neo_sodom: The github account got compromised, why would you trust it

14.4.2022, 16:16:23 - @allures:matrix.org: As you see the rooms are dead from basicly anony's vanish 
14.4.2022, 16:17:17 - @allures:matrix.org: Babba dont have the mental strenght to manage something, nor thinking good, she knows a lot in privacy security and stuff but she is down very down with thinking xD 
14.4.2022, 16:17:47 - neo_sodom: That said, please move the discussion to #bnonymity:matrix.org everyone
14.4.2022, 16:17:51 - @allures:matrix.org: As a normally person,  she is abnormal xD not in a good way xD

14.4.2022, 19:05:32 - hv: This room and the corresponding guide was created with the intention of more people being capable of evading such bad circumstances. Presumably anony only had an issue due to her having to expand her attack surface for the convenience of using so many platforms and running some infrastructure, plus also using a long-term psueodnym
14.4.2022, 19:06:01 - hv: Instead let's ask the new lurkers if they have any questions

14.4.2022, 19:08:30 - darlatan: anyway they'll be there in 3 hours
14.4.2022, 19:08:38 - hv: Do you even know where she is?
14.4.2022, 19:09:25 - darlatan: they'll look for a 22yo Ukrainian "Lena"
14.4.2022, 19:09:48 - toasterbirb: In an area spanning hundreds or thousands of kilometers?
14.4.2022, 19:10:14 - darlatan: no they're all in a big camp in the town of medyka at the polish border
14.4.2022, 19:10:26 - darlatan: the red cross probably has a registry 
14.4.2022, 19:12:31 - hv: larp stuff man. you don't even know if this isn't the usual "anonymous person runs project for x amount of time and terminates ungracefully" thing that happens sometimes
14.4.2022, 19:13:19 - hv: and that github message was allegedly automated, which could mean anything, not just direct threat
14.4.2022, 19:14:29 - darlatan: possible but I'll try ... is there anything to lose trying ? 
14.4.2022, 19:15:06 - darlatan: it's worth a shot

14.4.2022, 19:28:37 - darlatan: I joined this matrix thing today just for the purpose of finding information about her whereabouts
14.4.2022, 19:37:13 - darlatan: Does anyone has any information about her? Anything?
14.4.2022, 19:37:29 - darlatan: Besides what's in that "possibly fake" message
14.4.2022, 19:38:25 - toasterbirb: Absolute no clue. She was as mysterious as someone who would write an Anonymity guide would be
14.4.2022, 19:39:09 - toasterbirb: She liked to add ... a tonne into her messages, if that's something
14.4.2022, 19:39:19 - darlatan: a tonne?
14.4.2022, 19:39:26 - darlatan: what's a tonne?

14.4.2022, 19:40:23 - darlatan: that won't help
14.4.2022, 19:40:33 - toasterbirb: Like that is not proof that you are talking to her, but I guess it was quite notable thing about her writing style
14.4.2022, 19:40:41 - darlatan: I need information about her like languages spoken or something for instance?
14.4.2022, 19:42:52 - darlatan: right now I got girl, 22, dark curly hair, first name Lena, Ukrainian refugee from Kyiv, likely wounded, probably traveling alone without any personal belonging
14.4.2022, 19:44:48 - darlatan: so my friends will head to the field hospital of MSF first
14.4.2022, 19:46:36 - darlatan: then red cross, then polish army field hospital
14.4.2022, 19:47:30 - darlatan: as far as I know, there are no other field hospitals there at the moment
14.4.2022, 19:53:00 - darlatan: is there any polish speaker here?
14.4.2022, 19:55:28 - darlatan: Someone speaks Ukrainian?
14.4.2022, 20:13:06 - mazerfaker: okay, please go back to off topic. This went for waaayy too long than it has to

14.4.2022, 21:56:01 - paulux23: Hello !! Please I need your help. 

 I am an activist and I need to access some government websites.

 Tor IP are banned, that's why I only use a VPN ( Express VPN, no log VPN bought with btc and a protonmail email adress. ). Moreover, Javascript is needed, that's why I have to enable Javascript. I also need to download files. 

I have tried once to access it threw Duckduckgo but it did not work. Maybe it was not because of Duckduckgo, but that's why I'd prefer to use Google if it's not an issue. 

As a consequence, I usually try to access these websites with : Express VPN ( IP and DNS server ) + Firefox "incognito mode"  with javascript enabled, Webrtc disabled and https + Google + Internet on a router / on my phone with the localisation / bluetooh disabled. I can also buy prepaid chips in you tell me it's necessary.  Then, I download pdf files. 

However, I have red that javascript, flash and downloading pdf files could leak my IP adress even if I use a VPN. Is it true ? Is it my public IP adress / something which can make them see who I am ?  Moreover, could you please advise me on I could do to remain anonymous ?? 

Thank you very much in advance !! 
14.4.2022, 22:17:54 - paulux23: In short : 

How can my anonymity be broken if I use a no log VPN bought in bitcoin + Firefox "incognito mode" https with javascript enabled but Webrtc disabled + Google ( not connected to my account ) + internet on a router with a prepaid chip ? ( I am an activist, I can't use Tor, javascript is necessary and I have to download pdf). 
14.4.2022, 22:18:54 - toasterbirb: IP leaks are usually caused by DNS or IPv6 issues with the VPN-client, but I don't think JS and downloading files risks any IP leaks assuming the VPN connection is system wide
14.4.2022, 22:19:39 - paulux23: Thank you for your answer, I use the DNS of my VPN and I have checked that there is no DNS leaks. Moreover I don't use Ipv6. 
14.4.2022, 22:20:18 - toasterbirb: Have you deliberately disabled IPv6? Websites use it automatically if its available
14.4.2022, 22:21:45 - toasterbirb: I remember having leaks with IPv6 and ProtonVPN client without even noticing it. Dunno if they have fixed it and also don't know if there are similar issues with other VPN services.
14.4.2022, 22:21:53 - paulux23: My vpn does not use it 
14.4.2022, 22:22:07 - paulux23: okay I ll check though 
14.4.2022, 22:22:42 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "My vpn does not use it "> That is the thing. It might just let IPv6 go trough your regular connection
14.4.2022, 22:23:21 - toasterbirb: You can usually disable IPv6 on the router level or in your firewall settings etc.
14.4.2022, 22:24:07 - paulux23: Ok I ll check it 
14.4.2022, 22:24:22 - toasterbirb: Also when it comes to JavaScript, you don't have to decide if you want to block everything or nothing. You can whitelist scripts one by one until you reach the minimum required functionality
14.4.2022, 22:26:07 - paulux23: Oh how can I do this ? 
14.4.2022, 22:26:14 - paulux23: WIth firefox ? 
14.4.2022, 22:26:22 - paulux23: Moreover can it leak my public IP ? 
14.4.2022, 22:26:28 - paulux23: even with a VPN ? 
14.4.2022, 22:32:20 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "Oh how can I do this ? "> I use the NoScript addon
14.4.2022, 22:32:46 - toasterbirb: It is in the Tor browser by default
14.4.2022, 22:34:58 - paulux23: Okay, and can't the noscript addon disclose my activites if requested by a government ? I am indeed an actisit 
14.4.2022, 22:35:13 - paulux23: I can't use Tor browser as Tor IP are banned on the website I visit 
14.4.2022, 22:35:59 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "I can't use Tor browser as Tor I..."> It is a JavaScript blocking add-on available for Firefox. 
14.4.2022, 22:37:02 - toasterbirb: I use it to get rid of tracking and ad scripts that 99% of the web has these days
14.4.2022, 22:38:01 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "Okay, and can't the noscript add..."> Do you know how browser addons work...?
14.4.2022, 22:40:03 - paulux23: Okay, and would it prevent my IP to leak from javascript even if I had to allow a bit of javascript ? 
14.4.2022, 22:40:21 - paulux23: So I don't I am an activist not a computer scientist ^^
14.4.2022, 22:41:12 - toasterbirb: I have no idea how JavaScript could be used to bypass a system wide VPN connection
14.4.2022, 22:41:31 - toasterbirb: I'm not an expert in the matter though
14.4.2022, 22:41:44 - paulux23: okayy ty 
14.4.2022, 22:42:24 - toasterbirb: JavaScript is problematic usually due to its use for browser fingerprinting
14.4.2022, 22:42:57 - toasterbirb: There are bazillion small details about your browser and the operating system that can be identified using JavaScript
14.4.2022, 22:43:46 - toasterbirb: Also cookies etc. can be used to track you across websites and create a profile that way
14.4.2022, 22:46:12 - paulux23: okay 
14.4.2022, 22:46:12 - toasterbirb: Your IP is just a drop in the bucket of details that makes you specifically identifiable online
14.4.2022, 22:46:25 - paulux23: And how can I be safe from it ? 
14.4.2022, 22:46:39 - paulux23: How can I prevent my IP from being leaked ? 
14.4.2022, 22:46:57 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "And how can I be safe from it ? "> It is a can if worms you are opening. It is quite a rabbit hole
14.4.2022, 22:47:58 - toasterbirb: This is one of the main reasons why you use the tor browser and not connect to tor via Firefox for example. The aim of the Tor browser is to make everyone look the same
14.4.2022, 22:52:58 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "How can I prevent my IP from bei..."> I think you have seen too many NordVPN sponsorships
14.4.2022, 22:54:48 - paulux23: Yes but I can't use tor 
14.4.2022, 22:59:22 - darlatan: there is a 22yo Lena in the MSF field hospital 
14.4.2022, 22:59:42 - darlatan: she fits the description
14.4.2022, 23:02:12 - darlatan: she's unconscious and severely wounded, they'll transfer her to a real hospital when she's stabilized
14.4.2022, 23:04:07 - darlatan: she's under sedation with a respirator and cannot be talked to, but she came there alone
14.4.2022, 23:04:35 - darlatan: At the Polish border in Medyka
14.4.2022, 23:07:14 - darlatan: If Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla) can confirm the legitimacy of the gist then it's possible that it's her
14.4.2022, 23:09:12 - darlatan: they consider her state "worrying" but not "critical" 
14.4.2022, 23:10:08 - darlatan: she's been there for 2 weeks
14.4.2022, 23:12:03 - darlatan: And she tested positive for covid19 too
14.4.2022, 23:15:45 - darlatan: I think this might actually be her!
14.4.2022, 23:29:56 - darlatan: Ok they have all the info, their plan is to transfer her to Germany when she's stable
14.4.2022, 23:58:16 - mazerfaker: can you stop?
14.4.2022, 23:58:41 - mazerfaker: seriously, last warning
14.4.2022, 23:59:19 - maserati20: what is deeper network  or dpn
15.4.2022, 00:00:07 - maserati20: is it safe or another insecure device
15.4.2022, 00:01:01 - maserati20: https://shop.deeper.network/buy
15.4.2022, 00:40:50 - 0xbad1dea: looks like a device used to support their decentralized network, which uses P2P encryption to build a sort of mesh network I guess? It purports to better than a VPN without providing much substance as to how or why besides "it's decentralized". I'd probably give it a pass, personally. 
15.4.2022, 00:49:30 - hv: Their website is very flashy and thus gives very little indication of how their product functions
15.4.2022, 00:50:39 - hv: The first thing I see isn't academic paper & git server link, but instead pricing and pictures
15.4.2022, 00:51:52 - hv: They list a bunch of YouTubers (audaciously called 'influencers' nowadays) that they could have paid to give their opinion about their product
15.4.2022, 00:52:47 - hv: https://deeper-network.medium.com/5-ways-the-deeper-network-protects-you-204d563a49e5
15.4.2022, 00:55:09 - hv: Does it make people themselves into exit relays on their network...? They don't say, and they wouldn't say even if that was the case, I think
15.4.2022, 00:58:09 - hv: They also dropped blockchain on it for some reason, and I'm not really sure why. If they want you to stake some crypto to join a p2p network to prevent spammy / sybil actors, fine- I fail to see why that would require a NEW cryptocurrency, rather than using existing ones like Monero or something.
15.4.2022, 01:00:47 - hv: They even have a Terms of Service for the hardware, software, and network of their 'decentralized' product - https://shop.deeper.network/terms-of-service
15.4.2022, 01:04:32 - hv: Reading their latest blog posts I ctrl+f for ``open`` and find lots of language implying that their tech will 'open' things and no references to 'open source' or 'free/libre software'
15.4.2022, 01:04:55 - hv: Ah, here's a paper by them: https://deeper.network/assets/pdf/whitepaper/Deeper-WP-EN-1009.pdf
15.4.2022, 01:07:28 - hv: There is a sentence in their paper which claims their security measures make it **impossible** for any crackers to gain remote access to their hardware üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
15.4.2022, 01:08:04 - hv: > Deeper Connect employs triple encryption technology to guarantee the security of
storage devices. Even if the hardware device is lost, nobody can crack into the data
stored on the device. Triple encryption technology includes block device encryption,
file system encryption, and file encryption.
15.4.2022, 01:08:06 - hv: üòÇ
15.4.2022, 01:15:33 - hv: <@maserati20:matrix.org "is it safe or another insecure d..."> It's a heap of garbage. All hardware, software, whatever is proprietary and could easily be used to spy, either by them or by court order. Also they take dubious design decisions playing into this "web 3.0" crypto scam crap, looking to fill up their pockets. They only list walled garden social media that requires running of nonfree programs or javascript (web) and they seem to imply they have some kind of legal control of users' activities using their network product
15.4.2022, 01:18:05 - hv: It's a shame to see such efforts going towards this kind of profiteering instead of something useful.

Think about it- if they really wanted to do this, they could fork just Tor and turn it into a decentralized pay-for-bandwidth scheme
15.4.2022, 02:03:28 - SlickRick: paulux23: I believe you can use tor browser without routing your traffic through the Tor network. This will provide the fingerprinting defense etc. of the browser.

https://www.ghacks.net/2018/11/26/can-you-use-the-tor-browser-without-tor-connection/ see this and do some further research on it
15.4.2022, 02:03:51 - SlickRick: As someone said, otherwise use noscript to disable as much as you can and still access the site
15.4.2022, 02:04:19 - SlickRick: Without any specifics, how frequent do you need to be connecting to the internet for sensitive activities?
15.4.2022, 02:04:24 - SlickRick: First of all, have you read the guide?
15.4.2022, 02:05:03 - SlickRick: If it is only infrequently to download things etc. you should be looking at using public wifi where you aren't expose to surveilance cameras. You can use wifi-extenders to be further away and get on the wifi.
15.4.2022, 02:05:57 - SlickRick: If you do that, or connect to public wifi in any way to do this, you will want to randomise your MAC address, which is a unique hardware identifier of your network card in your computer that was set by the manufacturer. This is relatively easy to do, and you can look up how online.
15.4.2022, 02:06:50 - SlickRick: VPN's offer some protection, but they are not a great level of protection. Using public wifi where you can't be recorded and observed with randomized MAC + the VPN that isn't tied to you is a much better solution.
15.4.2022, 02:07:31 - SlickRick: If you paid for your VPN anonymously with cryptocurrency that is good, but if you are connecting to the VPN via your home network, it doesn't matter if you bought the VPN anonymously, you are tied to the VPN with your home IP.
15.4.2022, 02:07:34 - SlickRick: Nachricht gel√∂scht
15.4.2022, 02:08:39 - SlickRick: When you say a 'logless vpn', you need to be careful about claims these companies make which aren't auditable. Especially if you are staking your freedom on it. Some will say they don't log, and log, and others will log on request. I've seen Mullvad VPN touted as a more reliable VPN, which can be purchased with Monero, a more private crypto.
15.4.2022, 02:10:07 - SlickRick: If you go online to a crypto exchange, and then use your bank or credit card to buy the bitcoin, then that bitcoin is linked to your name. It doesn't matter that the purchase was in BTC, they can look at the fact that x sent btc from this address, and he got that from y address, which is a big exchanges address.

Ok, so we will now request the bitcoin exchange to tell use who they sent .3btc to at blah blah time, and they have you.
15.4.2022, 02:10:38 - SlickRick: Monero is better about shielding your identity, which makes purchasing Mullvad via Monero a better choice. if you go to moneros site, they don't sell it via Monero themselves, but they have resellers who sell you 3months worth for Monero, so look for them.
15.4.2022, 02:11:02 - SlickRick: This is some basic information, please ask any questions you have. paulux23
