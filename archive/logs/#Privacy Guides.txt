1.6.2022, 23:27:29 - Tommy: It doesnt hide what I am visiting from the provider but make me blend in with other people and prevent ip based tracking
1.6.2022, 23:27:51 - Tommy: custom DNS doesnt even shift trust from one provider to another, its just adding another provider to trust
1.6.2022, 23:28:09 - Tommy: then loudly announce that you are bypassing censorship and which exact site ur trying to visit is
1.6.2022, 23:28:33 - Tommy: it is also useless against any censorship system that does not rely solely on DNS

1.6.2022, 23:52:58 - Tommy: the teleco still knows which site you visit regardless of what dns server you use
1.6.2022, 23:53:08 - Tommy: if I am not fine with that I fire up my vpn or tor
1.6.2022, 23:54:59 - fogstick: I think i just use 9.9.9.9 when i'm on LTE, I don't want to use telco dns servers 
1.6.2022, 23:55:06 - ThinkMoreDifferent: <@fogstick:matrix.org "how could you tommy, why would I..."> ISPs are collecting DNS data and selling customer profiles in some countries.
1.6.2022, 23:56:38 - fogstick: his point is that regardless of what you do the telco will still see the dns traffic 
1.6.2022, 23:56:57 - ThinkMoreDifferent: ISPs are forced to perform redirects via manipulated DNS answers in some jurisdictions for LEA and police trojans.
1.6.2022, 23:57:06 - fogstick: even if I point to another dns server, it still goes through the telco infrastracture and is not encrypted in the first place 
1.6.2022, 23:58:11 - fogstick: I just personally don't want to use telco dns servers and rather use quad9 or w/e when i'm not on VPN or home network 
1.6.2022, 23:58:23 - ThinkMoreDifferent: <@fogstick:matrix.org "his point is that regardless of ..."> Depends on what they need to log. If they need to log only requests to their servers using a different server avoids logging. The provider still would be able to see the traffic. For this you could use DoT or DoH DNS.

2.6.2022, 00:04:36 - ThinkMoreDifferent: Why are the problems simplified here always?
2.6.2022, 00:04:51 - mazerfaker: what?
2.6.2022, 00:05:28 - ThinkMoreDifferent: You should not use your providers DNS if you are able to find a trustworthy non-logging one.
2.6.2022, 00:05:48 - mazerfaker: your ISP can still log what sites you go to?
2.6.2022, 00:05:59 - ThinkMoreDifferent: You should use DoT or DoH, DNSSEC.
2.6.2022, 00:06:09 - mazerfaker: DNSSEC isnt even in your hands to set up
2.6.2022, 00:06:42 - mazerfaker: afaik your registrar provides that
2.6.2022, 00:06:53 - mazerfaker: and even then, if there is HTTPS, afaik you dont need DNSSEC
2.6.2022, 00:07:12 - ThinkMoreDifferent: You should use VPN if you do not trust your ISP and trust the VPN provider more.
2.6.2022, 00:07:34 - ThinkMoreDifferent: You should use anonymization if you want to be anonymous.
2.6.2022, 00:07:59 - mazerfaker: <@jau2o-dk45a3:artemislena.eu "your ISP can still log what site..."> (it literally says the whole ass domain in the headers)
2.6.2022, 00:08:08 - mazerfaker: even if you use DoH/T
2.6.2022, 00:09:11 - grintea: people not understanding http handshake works
2.6.2022, 00:09:13 - grintea: average day in main
2.6.2022, 00:09:34 - ThinkMoreDifferent: Why do you assume this?
2.6.2022, 00:10:05 - grintea: because if you knew how the client handshake works then you would also know that DoT/DoH is useless until ECH is wider adopted
2.6.2022, 00:10:44 - grintea: almost nobody uses ECH, so using DoT/DoH is not "hiding" anything from your provider because the name is still in plaintext in your handshake
2.6.2022, 00:11:11 - mazerfaker: >almost nobody uses ECH

+1

You *only* need to provide TLS 1.3 *and* you need to manually enable it
2.6.2022, 00:12:06 - mazerfaker: and its not even on you, the person connecting the site, to enable ECH

so not only it has to be widely adopted, it has to be *required*
2.6.2022, 00:12:12 - ThinkMoreDifferent: My point was that problems here are simplified. "just use https" is not a good answer, if you can shift trust to other, more trustworthy, parties, use additional encryption for DNS, addtional validation for DNS, VPN, anonymization.
2.6.2022, 00:12:27 - mazerfaker: thats the point

DoH/T does not shift trust
2.6.2022, 00:12:34 - mazerfaker: it literally adds another party you need to trust
2.6.2022, 00:12:55 - ThinkMoreDifferent: <@grintea:nltrix.net "almost nobody uses ECH, so using..."> Does not mean we can start to hide the DNS requests. Somewhere we need to start.
2.6.2022, 00:12:57 - mazerfaker: it doesnt hide anything from your ISP, it just adds your 3rd party server you need to trust
2.6.2022, 00:14:00 - ThinkMoreDifferent: <@jau2o-dk45a3:artemislena.eu "thats the point"> Using a different DNS server does not shift trust?
2.6.2022, 00:14:11 - mazerfaker: Indeed it does not shift trust
2.6.2022, 00:14:24 - ThinkMoreDifferent: lol
2.6.2022, 00:14:59 - mazerfaker: Whats the point of using DoH/T? To hide DNS queries from people who have access to your network

Your ISP can literally see the SNI of a website in the headers
2.6.2022, 00:15:13 - mazerfaker: you would not do a DNS request to a site you werent gonna go 
2.6.2022, 00:15:37 - ThinkMoreDifferent: The trust shift is regarding who answers your DNS request.
2.6.2022, 00:16:05 - mazerfaker: so you are saying that an ISP owned DNS server is not your ISP?
2.6.2022, 00:17:02 - ThinkMoreDifferent: No. I am saying you should use a non ISP DNS to shift the trust to a more trustworhty non logging party.
2.6.2022, 00:17:19 - mazerfaker: your DNS server is owned by your ISP

they are the same party
2.6.2022, 00:17:31 - mazerfaker: they can log your shit in millions of ways
2.6.2022, 00:17:44 - 3bob: four times I looked at SNI and thought I saw SNL
2.6.2022, 00:18:41 - ThinkMoreDifferent: <@jau2o-dk45a3:artemislena.eu "your DNS server is owned by your..."> I would not use their DNS server if they would pay me for using it.
2.6.2022, 00:19:01 - mazerfaker: mate

think
2.6.2022, 00:19:13 - mazerfaker: think it as if its owned by 1 person
2.6.2022, 00:19:26 - mazerfaker: that person can see what sites you visit even though you dont use his DNS
2.6.2022, 00:19:38 - mazerfaker: is there a point in hiding your DNS?
2.6.2022, 00:20:42 - ThinkMoreDifferent: Yes, e.g. if they need to log requests received by their own servers.
2.6.2022, 00:20:53 - mazerfaker: I fucking give up
2.6.2022, 00:21:33 - ThinkMoreDifferent: I am looking at each topic singularily. You do not.
