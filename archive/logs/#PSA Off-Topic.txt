Actually if you'd been paying attention you'd know she died in surgery to remove shrapnel from her heart
27.4.2022, 08:03:16 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): The most important thing when criticising something is to make sure you understand what it is you're criticising
27.4.2022, 08:03:55 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): It doesn't lend you any credibility when you're getting details wrong that have been public knowledge for multiple days
27.4.2022, 08:04:30 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): For fuck's sake, that question is answered on https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/about.html
27.4.2022, 08:05:55 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I'm starting to wonder if the people criticising Lena have even read her guide, or if they're just hanging around her community so they can claim to be knowledgable by proximity

27.4.2022, 08:50:01 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): They don't
27.4.2022, 08:50:33 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): So. Background, I'm not new here.
27.4.2022, 08:51:02 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): I'm an alt of someone who has been here a long time but left (willingly, not banned) for like 3 months 
27.4.2022, 08:51:13 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): so I skipped the whole thing
27.4.2022, 08:51:49 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): I made a room to invite people to do some OSINT to find some truth
27.4.2022, 08:52:13 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): result: nobody is able to provide any proof the narrative is wrong but still believe it's wrong
27.4.2022, 08:52:39 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): There's a reason they're not finding any proof
27.4.2022, 08:53:07 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): There's no conspiracy
27.4.2022, 08:53:12 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): There's no LARPing
27.4.2022, 08:53:22 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): There's no fake death
27.4.2022, 08:53:37 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): yes but what annoys me is that they're in a "guilty until proven innocent" attitude towards someone who did good, wanted good, and has a perfect reputation
27.4.2022, 08:53:58 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): if SuperAlex was telling me a story then I would lean the other way
27.4.2022, 08:54:18 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@trolljegeren:tchncs.de "yes but what annoys me is that t..."> Exactly
27.4.2022, 08:54:24 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): But we're talking about the person who spent more than a year to write that guide for free and created this whole community
27.4.2022, 08:54:33 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And then tried to unify them together
27.4.2022, 08:54:52 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And was a very decent moderator that never abused the powers
27.4.2022, 08:55:11 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): So to me I don't see a reason for going full retard suddenly
27.4.2022, 08:55:23 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Lena has until now been the most *un*controversial figure in the whole privacy community
27.4.2022, 08:56:46 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Madaidan is accusing me of being a larping alt of AnonyPla, Bashar, Darlatan
27.4.2022, 08:57:00 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): So I told him "fuck you" in public
27.4.2022, 08:57:25 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Madaidan is a prick. I've said that numerous times on the record and even to him directly
27.4.2022, 08:57:38 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Yesterday we had a public talk with Darlatan who told us she was cremated and that he was leaving for the netherlands today 
27.4.2022, 08:58:03 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And then I switched to French since I'm French and I wanted to verify 
27.4.2022, 08:58:15 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Yes that dude is a perfect native french speaker
27.4.2022, 08:58:31 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Where indeed Interpol HQ is based in Lyon
27.4.2022, 08:59:21 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Oh and all the idiots think this is a large scale conspiracy/larp organized by you
27.4.2022, 08:59:33 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And they think the 2000€ thing is a scam
27.4.2022, 08:59:49 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): One of my mods even told me they think I made this all up to userp her community
27.4.2022, 09:00:02 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): lol seriously? 2000€ ... that's like the LIDL cremation ... discount
27.4.2022, 09:00:38 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Darlatan paid the flights, the cremation, the flights to amsterdam and the flights to Lyon 
27.4.2022, 09:00:43 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): out of his own pocket
27.4.2022, 09:00:59 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And they think it's a fucking scam
27.4.2022, 09:01:16 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Honestly I don't blame Darlatan nor Bashar234 for leaving
27.4.2022, 09:01:31 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): the whole community is completely fucked up
27.4.2022, 09:01:46 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena) hat ein Bild gesendet. (Medien ausgelassen)
27.4.2022, 09:02:32 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Jeez
27.4.2022, 09:03:07 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Darlatan exlained to us yesterday that "yes he has a death certificate"
27.4.2022, 09:03:15 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): No he can't leak it
27.4.2022, 09:03:21 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): No he can't tell us her name
27.4.2022, 09:03:48 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Honestly I think this might just be people who never liked her to begin with taking the opportunity to discredit her
27.4.2022, 09:03:55 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Because it's a policeman taking risks here doing plenty of shit "off the books"
27.4.2022, 09:04:03 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): and he's risking his career
27.4.2022, 09:04:41 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Honestly I think this might just..."> And a bunch of paranoid idiots latching onto this out of a pathological need to uncover lies even when there's nothing to uncover
27.4.2022, 09:04:41 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): So no he won't reveal his identity as interpol agent, and no he won't reveal the full name of Lena 
27.4.2022, 09:06:08 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): I've never seen a community so hostile towards their founder and calling them a liar/scammer/troll 
27.4.2022, 09:06:41 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): That idiot from SPITE told us she raided their roomS (plural) to harass them ... 
27.4.2022, 09:07:17 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Truth is: she went one time in there in one room (SPITE) and basically said something in the lines of "fuck you" to Madaidan
27.4.2022, 09:07:22 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Period
27.4.2022, 09:08:00 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Actually a couple days before this started she *did* push pretty hard to try to get PSA to remove her as admin
27.4.2022, 09:08:40 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Why? You can remove yourself from your admin role
27.4.2022, 09:09:57 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): At the time I was confused. But looking back I think she was trying to find an excuse to revoke her privileges without doxxing herself
27.4.2022, 09:10:46 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Had she simply handed over the guide and disappeared, people would've asked questions and figured she might be from Ukraine
27.4.2022, 09:10:47 - Likely Big Tech joined the room
27.4.2022, 09:11:09 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): My only regret with this whole thing was not taking that as a hint
27.4.2022, 09:12:42 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): I think she went through hell anyway so she would have stopped anyway but not with a grotesque LARP as they say
27.4.2022, 09:13:41 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I can confirm she *was* planning on stopping and passing the torch
27.4.2022, 09:13:59 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Which is normal 
27.4.2022, 09:14:05 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): considering the context
27.4.2022, 09:15:06 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): and now all those idiots are turning to you being like a mega puppet master
27.4.2022, 09:15:37 - Likely Big Tech: Moving from #anonymity:matrix.org to here makes me feel sane.
27.4.2022, 09:16:07 - Likely Big Tech: Everyone there talking about her death being fake is crazy as hell.
27.4.2022, 09:18:22 - Likely Big Tech: People here actually aren’t crazy conspiracy theorists.
27.4.2022, 09:18:37 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And this bashar dude made a good resume 
27.4.2022, 09:18:58 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): dngray So I asked many people what and I got this:

    Hostile people were in Kyiv and she was living in northern outskirts/suburbs alone
    Her place was in building between Ukrainians and hostile people
    She was sleeping and they shot door open and used jamming device to disable cell phones
    They forced unlocking her laptop (this is when all got deleted)
    After 2 or 3 days ,those people got drunk and she escaped and ran to Ukrainians
    She received first aid from a medic but need doctor
    She was then on truck in group of 3 trucks to south west and she was in middle truck, all trucks full civilians and with red cross on top
    Last truck of convoy was destroyed next day by Russian plane
    Next day her truck was shot by Kalashnikov and people died in the truck and she got shot
    Later she lost consciousness
    She arrived at Polish border at Medyka and was put into MSF field hospital
    She stayed there for 2-3 weeks
    Automatic message was posted saying that if that was posted she was in bad situation
    A cop from Interpol in France (@darlatan:matrix.org) came here for informations and said he sent 2 polish cops to camp to look for her with description from automatic post
    They arrived 3-4 hours later and found one single person with description
    Next day was transported on polish military plane to Munich Germany hospital
    She was woken up days later and a german cop came and gave a tablet she used to try to contact family, friend and then came here
    Then she came every day and tried to prove identity which was in the end verified as legitimate by many
    She said the people who were after her were not Russian army but group of Chechnians
    Then she died during surgery

27.4.2022, 09:19:11 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@likelybigtech:matrix.org "People here actually aren’t craz..."> All the crazy conspiracy theorists insist repurposing other rooms for this discussion
27.4.2022, 09:19:27 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): That's what Bashar gathered in a couple of days
27.4.2022, 09:19:44 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): When you actually *give* them a place to talk about it it's a violation of their free speech
27.4.2022, 09:20:16 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): They also think she is a liar because she used the word Kiev instead of Kyiv once
27.4.2022, 09:20:27 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): But Kiev is the English name of Kyiv
27.4.2022, 09:20:59 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): It's like they don't realize her guide specifically discusses linguistic analysis
27.4.2022, 09:22:39 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): An anonymity person trying to protect their anonymity?
27.4.2022, 09:22:42 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Unheard of
27.4.2022, 09:23:15 - Likely Big Tech: <@trolljegeren:tchncs.de "But Kiev is the English name of ..."> Kind of like Myanmar and Burma.
27.4.2022, 09:23:18 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And every single time someone new comes in ... they make sure that person knows it's a lie and that the admin is corrupt etc 
27.4.2022, 09:23:50 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And now Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena) you are their target 
27.4.2022, 09:24:03 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): If I was corrupt these people would've been gone a long time ago
27.4.2022, 09:24:22 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@trolljegeren:tchncs.de "And now Babba27's Evil Twin (Dri..."> Yeah, I noticed
27.4.2022, 09:24:37 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): <@likelybigtech:matrix.org "Kind of like Myanmar and Burma."> There are plenty of countries where cities have different names depending on the language
27.4.2022, 09:25:35 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): The problem with their arguments is they legitimately have no basis. Everyone knows all good lies need to be at least rooted in truth
27.4.2022, 09:26:02 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Well I think it's time for this 
27.4.2022, 09:26:14 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod) hat ein Bild gesendet. (Medien ausgelassen)

27.4.2022, 09:27:39 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And you are right
27.4.2022, 09:27:41 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): They have no arguments 
27.4.2022, 09:28:06 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): We have a principle on this planet in democratic countries which is "innocent until proven guilty"
27.4.2022, 09:28:26 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): The burden of proof is on people making accusations 
27.4.2022, 09:28:39 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): They're invoking almost every fallacy in the book just to avoid being laughed out of the room
27.4.2022, 09:31:29 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): and mazerfaker and the other left because they too believe it's BS ?
27.4.2022, 09:31:36 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): the whole thing?
27.4.2022, 09:31:37 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Yup
27.4.2022, 09:31:57 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): great mods ... she would be "proud" (/s) 
27.4.2022, 09:32:05 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): what a shame
27.4.2022, 09:32:36 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I know. I'm kind of wondering if it's for the best that the community dies
27.4.2022, 09:33:05 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): This whole thing is so disheartening. I'm just trying to keep her project alive
27.4.2022, 09:33:28 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): And now the greatest threat to her community is itself
27.4.2022, 09:33:49 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): No it shouldn't
27.4.2022, 09:34:05 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): But a purge might be required
27.4.2022, 09:34:06 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I know it shouldn't. I'm just venting right now
27.4.2022, 09:34:43 - Likely Big Tech: Why do people believe that Babba wants to take over by using 10 alts?
27.4.2022, 09:34:57 - Likely Big Tech: It’s hard to maintain that many alts anyway.
27.4.2022, 09:35:09 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): She didn't die just so I could give up and let everything she worked so hard for die with her
27.4.2022, 09:35:25 - Likely Big Tech: Yeah
27.4.2022, 09:36:53 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Anyway I volunteer and would like to apply as at least interim mod of #anonymity:matrix.org #bnonymity:matrix.org and #security:matrix.org and will stick to your rules if you update them on the site
27.4.2022, 09:37:59 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Seeing as my most active mods are gone now, I think that would be very helpful
27.4.2022, 09:38:01 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Thank you
27.4.2022, 09:38:15 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And I wont tolerate defamation
27.4.2022, 09:39:01 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): warning > kick > ban or mute ... up to you 
27.4.2022, 09:39:16 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): (and this room too I guess
27.4.2022, 09:39:37 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I created this room specifically for discussion of whether she's actually dead
27.4.2022, 09:39:49 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): oh I made one too you know :p
27.4.2022, 09:40:39 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): come and see the room I made and the batshit crazy things they said in there
27.4.2022, 09:40:42 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): But really all the idiots are frequenting bnonymity now so this room is just a place for the people with brains to discuss rationally
27.4.2022, 09:41:25 - Likely Big Tech: Why are they visiting bnonymity now instead of here?
27.4.2022, 09:41:35 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Since bnony was an edgelord and troll enclosure from the beginning, I think this all works out pretty well
27.4.2022, 09:42:06 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@likelybigtech:matrix.org "Why are they visiting bnonymity ..."> Because I told them to move the discussion here, which is the most reliable way to ensure these people will never join this room
27.4.2022, 09:42:41 - Likely Big Tech: I guess this room will be more chill now
27.4.2022, 09:42:42 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Since bnony was an edgelord and ..."> I'm perfectly okay with them being edgelords on #bnonymity:matrix.org as it is the point of the room indeed
27.4.2022, 09:43:34 - Likely Big Tech: Changing the topic, why would someone use other homeserver instead of matrix.org for matrix?
27.4.2022, 09:44:09 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Matrix.org is somewhat controversial, as it's the largest by far
27.4.2022, 09:44:40 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Using matrix.org could be considered to be contributing to a de facto monopoly, which sort of goes against the point of a federated protocol
27.4.2022, 09:45:33 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): It's actually a valid concern IMO
27.4.2022, 09:45:58 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I, myself, recommend people use an alternative homeserver for that exact reason
27.4.2022, 09:46:32 - Likely Big Tech: <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "It's actually a valid concern IM..."> What could be the possible risks in this scenario?
27.4.2022, 09:47:51 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Centralizing to the same homeserver affords a single entity the ability to decide unilaterally how the protocol should develop
27.4.2022, 09:48:31 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): The same issue happened with Google and XMPP at one point, and has been happening for years with the web and Chrome
27.4.2022, 09:48:40 - Likely Big Tech: <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Centralizing to the same homeser..."> Would that be the case if everyone uses the same client to access Matrix, such as Element?
27.4.2022, 09:49:06 - Likely Big Tech: Kind of like chromium?
27.4.2022, 09:49:15 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@likelybigtech:matrix.org "Would that be the case if everyo..."> Yup
27.4.2022, 09:49:45 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Another efect of centralizing to a single homeserver is intelligence agencies only need to go to one place for the data of every user
27.4.2022, 09:51:27 - Likely Big Tech: <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Another efect of centralizing to..."> Or a malicious third party (such as hackers) could hack that homeserver and take the data.
27.4.2022, 09:51:34 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Exactly
27.4.2022, 09:52:00 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): While Matrix's E2EE protects against them getting message contents, homeservers know the metadata of every user
27.4.2022, 09:52:56 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I wrote an article about that a while back
27.4.2022, 09:52:57 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): https://web.archive.org/web/20210203223156/https://serpentsec.1337.cx/matrix
27.4.2022, 09:53:04 - Likely Big Tech: <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "While Matrix's E2EE protects aga..."> So that means if you were looking for a homeserver, you must trust them with your metadata.
27.4.2022, 09:53:44 - Likely Big Tech: Found this on matrix.org

“Who is building Matrix?

The core team is ~12 people with extensive experience in building custom VoIP and Messaging apps for mobile network operators. Most of us work for Element, but there are an increasing number of contributors from other companies and folks”
27.4.2022, 09:53:48 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Yup. You also have to trust your contacts' homeservers with your metadata
27.4.2022, 09:54:13 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Yup. You also have to trust your..."> Since a conversation's metadata is shared among all participating homeservers
27.4.2022, 09:54:24 - Likely Big Tech: <@likelybigtech:matrix.org "Found this on matrix.org"> That probably explains why Element always gets the new features first.
27.4.2022, 09:54:49 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Yup. It's largely the same devs
27.4.2022, 09:56:17 - Likely Big Tech: <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "Since a conversation's metadata ..."> I’m sure there isn’t too much sensitive metadata because most metadata is just time sent, sent from who, for who.
27.4.2022, 09:56:42 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): That *is* sensitive information, are you kidding?
27.4.2022, 09:57:08 - Likely Big Tech: Well not too sensitive 
27.4.2022, 09:57:08 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): The NSA literally decides who to kill based on metadata
27.4.2022, 09:57:52 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Although it's also more than that. Profile pics, display names, and message reactions are also sent unencrypted on Matrix
27.4.2022, 09:58:13 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "https://web.archive.org/web/2021..."> This article has more details about Matrix's metadata issues
27.4.2022, 09:58:32 - Likely Big Tech: <@memorysafetybelike:envs.net "The NSA literally decides who to..."> Like if someone messages a drug dealer at 6am and then their phone metadata shows them at an alleyway at 7am, you can assume what happened
27.4.2022, 09:58:44 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Exactly
27.4.2022, 09:59:58 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Of course it could be a misunderstanding, but since when does the NSA care about things like evidence or being sure they're killing the right person
27.4.2022, 10:02:09 - Likely Big Tech: I’m doing it from the homeserver’s point of view with some location metadata.
27.4.2022, 10:02:31 - Likely Big Tech: But it can definitely be misunderstood by someone
27.4.2022, 10:08:13 - Likely Big Tech: My favourite example of the dangers of metadata is from Techlore’s Go Incognito: 

“They know you rang a phone sex line at 4am and spoke for 18 minutes”, They know you called the suicide prevention line at the Golden Gate Bridge, they know you spoke to a HIV Testing Center, then your doctor and then your health insurance company”
27.4.2022, 10:12:42 - Likely Big Tech: It’s easy to assume what happen.

Where do you know Trolljegeren (ad interim mod) from ?
27.4.2022, 13:09:26 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): They don't
27.4.2022, 13:09:31 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: do you know him prior to 24hrs ago ?
27.4.2022, 13:10:16 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Yes because this account (mine) is an alt of another that was already on matrix for quite a long time
27.4.2022, 13:10:40 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: oh okay I see
27.4.2022, 13:10:50 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: and you knew each other ?
27.4.2022, 13:12:00 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): we probably exchanged a few DMs but most of the time I was a silent lurker
27.4.2022, 13:12:24 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): Unlike AnonyPla, I'm not seeking total anonymity
27.4.2022, 13:12:50 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: I'd argue neither was she
27.4.2022, 13:12:58 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: or did pretty bad
27.4.2022, 13:13:13 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): I am French, I am 41 yo, I work in IT, I live in Paris, I'm a standard he/him dude
27.4.2022, 13:13:52 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And I was probably moderating channels on IRC before someone you were born 
27.4.2022, 13:14:22 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: and how many alts do you have ? If I may :o
27.4.2022, 13:15:06 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): On Matrix? Oh this is my first 
27.4.2022, 13:15:10 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: not wanting to sound rude, sorry
27.4.2022, 13:15:26 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): but it's not really an alt since I deactivated the original
27.4.2022, 13:16:37 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): however I did not come here for like 3 months or so ... so I missed this whole issue with AnonyPla/Lena
27.4.2022, 13:16:51 - @alexa//saveplanet:envs.net: yeah I just arrived as well
27.4.2022, 13:17:29 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): now I proposed to be mod ad interim to restore the peace and enforce the rules

27.4.2022, 21:03:23 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): *Right*
27.4.2022, 21:03:40 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I'm not the one bringing baseless accusations against dead people
27.4.2022, 21:04:04 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I also am not surprised Madaidan and dngray came out of their holes for this

27.4.2022, 21:05:32 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Considering they both already held disdain
27.4.2022, 21:07:17 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): And dngray didn't even attempt to pretend to be unbiased. He came out straight away attempting to paint me as a villain
27.4.2022, 21:09:30 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): And Madaidan has been quick to bring accusations against Lena in the past
27.4.2022, 21:10:58 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): They seem comfortable with ad hominem, so I think turnabout's fair play
27.4.2022, 21:11:49 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): Anyone heard of the time dngray banned a user after making a joke out of their abuse as a child?
27.4.2022, 21:13:15 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I love how *these* are the people leading the charge with these accusations

28.4.2022, 05:55:00 - exv3: Hello everyone. May I ask what happened to Lena? I'm aware that she escaped from Ukraine and I was happy she's okay but then I saw on https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/about.html that she died in surgery. I'm so sad because I spoke to her few times and helped her in 2021 when the project was still in early development :(
28.4.2022, 06:15:19 - exv3: I was also supposed to create new design for the project but got carried away mainly by anxiety and because I wasn't feeling creative at that point. I really regret that I couldn't finish what I proposed myself when I was still in touch with her :(
28.4.2022, 06:25:58 - exv3: I'd like to continue what I proposed back then if you guys will let me help. I want to make sure that the new design will get more attention  and even more people will see her amazing work.
28.4.2022, 07:08:47 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): She died peacefully, without suffering during a very complex heart surgery involving removing a piece of shrapnel near (very near) her her heart. They were unable to save here despite hours of efforts.
28.4.2022, 07:09:50 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): In an unknown hospital in Munich, Germany
28.4.2022, 07:10:10 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): I was told they tried for about 8 hours before giving up

23.5.2022, 22:40:56 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Only thing to do is moderate when he comes in, like I said if he has an account, he can join
23.5.2022, 22:41:10 - qbw3ykpkzejp: You can't just ban his *@host
23.5.2022, 22:41:11 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I stopped being annoyed like 3 months ago. It's not hard to ban+redact his alts when he joins
23.5.2022, 22:41:29 - qbw3ykpkzejp: It's effectively a zline 
23.5.2022, 22:42:19 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I would not ban his entire host server but still ban *super* and tell people deal with it
23.5.2022, 22:43:01 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): And then what? He starts joining under different names?
23.5.2022, 22:43:42 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Exactly
23.5.2022, 22:44:12 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): It's a bit of a contradiction: the harder we try to make sure he doesn't join, the harder it becomes to do exactly that, since we'll just end up forcing him to become harder to ban
23.5.2022, 22:44:27 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Superparadox
23.5.2022, 22:45:10 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): With the way things are, he's predictable and the amount of actual damage he's doing to the community is basically none

23.5.2022, 22:45:49 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I don't see the harm in letting him continue to join under alts, shitpost a couple messages, and get banned
23.5.2022, 22:46:27 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Doesn't help I get a DM every time though for some reason
23.5.2022, 22:46:35 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Every alt he crafts
23.5.2022, 22:46:46 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I get like 3 DM's
23.5.2022, 22:47:01 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I'm not even sure why he thinks I'm important (lol?)
23.5.2022, 22:47:02 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): I found a trick to that. Ignore his DM for a couple days, then reject it
23.5.2022, 22:47:26 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): If you reject it immediately you're sending a signal that you care enough to reject it immediately
23.5.2022, 22:47:34 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (🕊️ Lena): So he'll keep DMing

Also wow $50 a year is cheep. For 2gb on my current provider I would be paying almost 3x that
04/07/2022, 16:53:25 - @batcherdink:envs.net: 1984.is is gooooood
04/07/2022, 16:53:56 - @adrian:envs.net: im bored too
04/07/2022, 16:54:33 - @batcherdink:envs.net: privex.io is somewhat cheaper sometimes ... with even unlimited bandwidth ... but you can't install the OS you want. You can't access the console. I don't trust them personally
04/07/2022, 16:55:18 - @batcherdink:envs.net: And then of course there is njal.la ... but ... twice the price of 1984 with twice less features. But their rep is the best.
04/07/2022, 16:55:34 - @batcherdink:envs.net: Yet I disagree ... for me 1984.is is clearly the best
04/07/2022, 16:55:41 - @batcherdink:envs.net: by far
04/07/2022, 16:58:23 - @batcherdink:envs.net: for privacy but even full blown anonymity
04/07/2022, 16:59:33 - @energized-winter:matrix.thetwelfth.com: I may look into switching providers; I currently use greenhost because when I was first getting into privacy I determined that dutch privacy law was strong(was I correct?), but I may want to reevaluate given the huge premium I am apparently paying.
04/07/2022, 17:04:02 - @energized-winter:matrix.thetwelfth.com: Also are you sure it's $50 a year? I am seeing $120 a year witch is very close to greenhost
04/07/2022, 17:05:52 - @batcherdink:envs.net: Check for yourself
