27.2.2022, 00:37:58 - suspiciousactions: im fine, thanks an you?
27.2.2022, 00:39:47 - oxmerku: im good! do you know if this chat is encrypted?
27.2.2022, 00:40:24 - suspiciousactions: This chatroom is public. Anybody can read it.
27.2.2022, 00:43:40 - @jstoropoli:matrix.org left the room
27.2.2022, 00:43:52 - suspiciousactions: If you mean Matrix in general: It is at least transport encrypted via HTTPS everywhere and e2e encrypted for private chats and most group chats. You can see the encryption status by clicking on any users picture. It is displayed on the right above the users session under "Security", or in the Settings of the channel under "Privacy and Security"
27.2.2022, 00:47:32 - oxmerku: ahh that makes sense. well i found this website that claims its an encrypted note keeper. so basically encrypted text editor, and i'm just curious if that's possible would an encrypted chat room be possible i guess through some sort of verification? not sure how it would work 
27.2.2022, 00:48:46 - oxmerku: and also is python whats being used to write encrypted apps?
27.2.2022, 00:49:41 - suspiciousactions: <@oxmerku:matrix.org "ahh that makes sense. well i fou..."> Ther are some encrypted pads out there. For example Cryptpad is e2e encrypted https://cryptpad.fr/ (at least they claim, have not looked at the crypto).

Sure encrypted chats are possible, but this specific one happens to be not e2e encrypted.
27.2.2022, 00:50:36 - suspiciousactions: python is a scripting language one can develop programs with it.

you can write encrypted apps in any script or programming language you like.
27.2.2022, 00:51:19 - oxmerku: sorry for the n00b questions im trying to take everything in all at once lol
27.2.2022, 00:51:26 - suspiciousactions: np

Personally I am focusing on allowing my public identity as much privacy as possible. 

While keeping another identity absolutely secret. But the more that second identity becomes used. The more the need for a 3rd or 4th pr√©sents itself

2.3.2022, 12:20:31 - suspiciousactions: First of all: You have to trust your OS and all the basic stuff like your keyboard. As always.
When it comes to phones and Tor, there is nothing that is impacting the security (confidentiality, integrity and accessibility), but note that it is much less anonymous to use a Tor browser on phones.

This is because phones are much more easy to fingerprint. Think of the many screen sizes there are and that there is no letterboxing mitigation on mobile. Besides that, there is simply more surface to fingerprint with, like what libraries are installed, what sensors are there, how many touchpoints are supported and so on. It is the best you got on mobile, but it just is not as anonymous like the desktop TBB.

There are other implications for privacy for Tor usage with mobile use (read: you usually take the device to different locations) too, like guard fingerprinting (scenario: you using your phone in different wifis), but this is honestly nothing to be concerned about, as mobile anonymity for phones is a shitshow anyways.

Would recommend keeping only one standalone device for this purpose

4.3.2022, 10:59:26 - bkilm: After looking through the combined git tree, It's a pity though, that they git reset/force push all the time and the changlog is not trivial. Surely this is due to checking in large binary files. üò• That's transparency for you.

The most downloaded apps in the war between Russia and Ukraine: from encrypted messaging to air raid alerts
4.3.2022, 20:35:00 - leopoldo89: The United States showed that it is always one step ahead in January, when it anticipated the official start of the war between Ukraine and Russia. At the beginning of the year, the North American country evacuated its staff from the Ukrainian embassy and gave a satellite phone to President Volodymyr Zelensky and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleva.
4.3.2022, 20:35:12 - bitmonero: I am a man over 18 years old. The Ukrainian government does not allow me to leave the country. I am afraid to try to escape the country and get caught. 
4.3.2022, 20:35:43 - leopoldo89: Satellite mobiles do not work like current smartphones and are essential so that there is no possibility of spying on those who use them. These devices do not work with cards or connect to the normal network, but their connection depends on space satellites.

The satellite phone network to which Zelensky and Kuleva's phones are connected is believed to be that of the 66-satellite Iridium constellation. Its communications satellites are located in 6 low orbits, at a height of approximately 780 kilometers above the earth's surface.
4.3.2022, 20:36:10 - bitmonero: > I am a man over 18 years old. The Ukrainian government does not allow me to leave the country. I am afraid to try to escape the country and get caught.

4.3.2022, 20:38:08 - leopoldo89: As revealed by a US official to CNN, Zelensky's group took several days to put into operation the device that the Joe Biden government had provided. The reason? The mobile instructions were in English.

Before the United States gave these devices to the Ukrainian president and the foreign minister, it seems that their mobile connections were made through the embassy of the North American country. In this way, they prevented Russia from spying on their messages.

Am I safe?
4.3.2022, 20:39:11 - leopoldo89: In addition to the Iridium network, there are also three other satellite networks for phones:

Inmarsat Network: It has 11 satellites that cover all the territories except the polar regions.
Red Thuraya: from Saudi Arabia. They have two satellites that cover more than 160 countries.
Globalstar Network: It has 44 satellites, they do not offer coverage to all areas.

If you want secure communication, you need to use everyday objects like a deck of cards.

ElsieFour: A Low-Tech Authenticated Encryption Algorithm For Human-to-Human Communication
Abstract: ElsieFour (LC4) is a low-tech cipher that can be computed by hand; but unlike many historical ciphers, LC4 is designed to be hard to break. LC4 is intended for encrypted communication between humans only, and therefore it encrypts and decrypts plaintexts and ciphertexts consisting only of the English letters A through Z plus a few other characters. LC4 uses a nonce in addition to the secret key, and requires that different messages use unique nonces. LC4 performs authenticated encryption, and optional header data can be included in the authentication. This paper defines the LC4 encryption and decryption algorithms, analyzes LC4's security, and describes a simple appliance for computing LC4 by hand.

> Talon: A playing card cipher
> Designing a secure manual encryption algorithm is a challenge. Some cryptographers have developed ciphers that require a deck of playing cards. The best-known one of this kind is Bruce Schneier‚Äôs Solitaire. Today, I am going to introduce another one: Talon by Aaron Toponce.

5.3.2022, 20:17:47 - SamLeh: mazerfaker: I don't personally have any reason to believe that it isn't true. But of course with limited information it's very hard to "confirm" it.
5.3.2022, 20:19:01 - mazerfaker: the first casualty in war is truth
5.3.2022, 20:19:10 - SamLeh: Btw. Many European countries now allow anyone with Ukraine passport to enter freely. In Finland there's also "in advance" announcement form, but they don't even ask identity information before you're in the country and you can enter the country freely. You just need to "check-in" later. So it's made as easy as it reasonably can. 
5.3.2022, 20:20:09 - mazerfaker: Perhaps not the best place to talk about it, but europeans countries are still very much racist ;d the EU is a christian boyz only club

7.3.2022, 07:03:44 - kumar337: Hello
7.3.2022, 07:04:08 - kumar337: What happened to anonymousplanet.org ???
7.3.2022, 07:08:29 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): It was taken down by the Russian military
7.3.2022, 07:08:46 - kumar337: Seriously?
7.3.2022, 07:09:44 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Yes
7.3.2022, 07:10:34 - kumar337: I don't understand? Is the author in Ukraine? 
7.3.2022, 07:10:59 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Yes, she's currently trying to flee
7.3.2022, 07:11:19 - kumar337: She? It's a woman? Omg
7.3.2022, 07:11:39 - toor: It could also be an excuse like discussed here before
7.3.2022, 07:12:04 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): I've verified, it's legit
7.3.2022, 07:12:23 - toor: How? Do you know her?
7.3.2022, 07:13:04 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Yes, she reached out after she escaped from the Russian military's custody to an area still held by the Ukranian military
7.3.2022, 07:13:20 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): She's fleeing with a group of civilians
7.3.2022, 07:13:42 - kumar337: I'm shocked
7.3.2022, 07:14:32 - kumar337: Is there anything we can do to help?
7.3.2022, 07:15:05 - kumar337: I donated XMR to the website recently 
7.3.2022, 07:15:43 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): <@kumar337:matrix.org "I donated XMR to the website rec..."> Oof, you basically donated to the Russian military
7.3.2022, 07:15:43 - kumar337: You think those donations are now in Russian hands?
7.3.2022, 07:15:51 - kumar337: omg
7.3.2022, 07:17:30 - kumar337: These are the last people on the planet I want to donate money to
7.3.2022, 07:17:59 - kumar337: This is fucked up
7.3.2022, 07:19:20 - kumar337: I'd rather donate money to north korea
7.3.2022, 07:19:25 - kumar337: than russia
7.3.2022, 07:21:33 - kumar337: omg she is a 22 year old ukrainian girl ? I just searched history of room
7.3.2022, 07:21:47 - somekool: <@kumar337:matrix.org "I'd rather donate money to north..."> Not a good idea. I don't support at all the attack on Ukraine. But to prefer the NK r√©gime is a huge mistake. 
7.3.2022, 07:22:17 - kumar337: <@somekool:matrix.org "Not a good idea. I don't support..."> I live in russian occupied territory
7.3.2022, 07:22:27 - kumar337: I hate russia
7.3.2022, 07:22:44 - kumar337: i hate putin
7.3.2022, 07:23:36 - somekool: I only recently learn many territories inside Russia are called republics. Like 30 of them or so... Do you think it would make sense for Russia to split further. Become 30 different countries?
7.3.2022, 07:23:58 - kumar337: no no no 
7.3.2022, 07:24:07 - kumar337: russian military is everywhere
7.3.2022, 07:24:31 - kumar337: this guide is how I can connect here
7.3.2022, 07:24:40 - somekool: Can't we disarm Russia and let people do their own thing? 
7.3.2022, 07:25:04 - kumar337: disarm russia? are you joking?
7.3.2022, 07:25:56 - kumar337: I'm english teacher her
7.3.2022, 07:26:13 - kumar337: This is sad
7.3.2022, 07:26:33 - somekool: So I am dreaming of a world that can be real? I should probably get back at knitting a scarf for my neighbor. 
7.3.2022, 07:26:54 - kumar337: Russian will never be disarmed 
7.3.2022, 07:27:11 - kumar337: They have soldiers everywhere 
7.3.2022, 07:27:26 - kumar337: Here we have checkpoints from russia on every road 
7.3.2022, 07:27:50 - kumar337: you cannot pass without paying them
7.3.2022, 07:28:52 - kumar337: it's corrupt
7.3.2022, 07:29:56 - kumar337: putin is an evil person
7.3.2022, 07:30:37 - somekool: Obviously I don't have an idea how things are over there. I am sad to hear that. I think everyone deserves peace. A "normal" life. Hopefully this conflict will end with ending Putin and his regime. 
7.3.2022, 07:30:53 - kumar337: so we cannot do anything to help her?
7.3.2022, 07:31:20 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Nope, all we can do is hope she survives long enough to escape Russian-controlled territory
7.3.2022, 07:31:29 - kumar337: I will pray for her
7.3.2022, 07:31:51 - kumar337: Maybe Allah will care for her
7.3.2022, 07:32:32 - kumar337: Inshallah
7.3.2022, 07:36:17 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): For anyone still wondering, the reason her friend hasn't taken over for her is because the Russian military got to her before she finished the transfer
7.3.2022, 07:37:00 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): She was forced to disclose her keys, then the military went through and deleted everything
7.3.2022, 07:37:50 - kumar337: I am not surprised
7.3.2022, 07:42:37 - toor: How do we know any of that is real?
7.3.2022, 07:43:25 - toor: It sounds plausible, but I also feel like she might have just used this situation to disappear for some other reason
7.3.2022, 07:44:15 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): <@toor:inetd.xyz "How do we know any of that is re..."> *You* don't. I guess you just have to trust me
7.3.2022, 07:44:52 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Or you can trust *her*
7.3.2022, 07:45:14 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Trust that she wouldn't have taken down the entire project just to burn an identity
7.3.2022, 07:48:25 - karlq: Hi all, can I get some advice please? On Tor, I keep getting connected to the same kinds of IP's.
7.3.2022, 07:48:37 - karlq: And they all IPlocate to "CIA Triad Security LLC"
7.3.2022, 07:53:46 - mikkael: kumar337: If above true then stop doxxing yourself and go review your checklists.
karlq : they run a bunch of exit nodes, yes.  "same kinds of ips" will likely be "same kind of ips".
7.3.2022, 07:54:52 - karlq: Just seems odd to get 5 new identities & most are all from the same source
7.3.2022, 07:54:55 - karlq: Doesn't seem all that random
7.3.2022, 07:55:27 - mikkael: they have lot of exit nodes
7.3.2022, 07:55:42 - karlq: What do you know about them? Is that not concerning?
7.3.2022, 07:56:00 - karlq: Obviously malicious exit nodes are a concern in Tor.
7.3.2022, 07:56:23 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): CIA Triad Security LLC is a very ominous-sounding name for a legitimate security company
7.3.2022, 07:56:41 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): CIA referring to *confidentiality, integrity, availability*
7.3.2022, 07:56:59 - mikkael: so ominous sounding as to be an ominous-sounding joke
7.3.2022, 07:57:07 - karlq: Yes I could see they were a legitimate company, I was just surprised to be seemingly unable to create a new Tor identity without getting one.
7.3.2022, 08:00:33 - mikkael: tor user matrix room has nice people (#tor:matrix.org iirc)
7.3.2022, 08:12:50 - mikkael: should help understanding about exit %s: https://nusenu.github.io/OrNetStats/

7.3.2022, 09:49:29 - karlq: I just don't understand some of these rooms that get huges numbers of new members joining and zero messages
7.3.2022, 09:49:40 - karlq: Is there a broader list of rooms & that is just an unused one?

7.3.2022, 09:54:17 - mikkael: Like many rooms, Tor Users is bursty.  Quiet for days then suddenly 200 chats.  Its a good place to ask questions.  Good answers usually come back.
7.3.2022, 09:56:16 - mikkael: kumar337: learn quickly, stay safe, prepare youself and those around you.
7.3.2022, 09:56:56 - suspiciousactions: <@karlq:matrix.org "Is there a broader list of rooms..."> it is used, but it is just the tor user support room. So not that much traffic.
There are tor project, tor development and tor offtopic rooms too. dev has muc htraffic, but only dev2dev talk. pls don't disturb.

7.3.2022, 10:01:45 - suspiciousactions: As it is a threat intelligence company, one could suspect that they monitor the exit traffic... Tho the CCC and zwiebelfreunde host there and those are pretty big relay operators.
7.3.2022, 10:02:42 - mikkael: ze german cypherfolk be trollin
7.3.2022, 10:02:58 - suspiciousactions: maybe. The name is funny AF to be honest.
7.3.2022, 10:03:05 - suspiciousactions: but a threat intelligence comapny?
7.3.2022, 10:03:06 - suspiciousactions: really?
7.3.2022, 10:04:36 - suspiciousactions: dunno.. waiting for an answer. Talked to arma about that once "seeing a big relay family run by a threat intelligence company" and he was like "we don't want them, you got a list of relays?". Could not think of the name at that time tho.
I misremembered. They are not directly run by them, but go through their AS.
7.3.2022, 10:05:31 - mikkael: see link above for breakdown
7.3.2022, 10:06:21 - suspiciousactions: what link?
7.3.2022, 10:06:30 - suspiciousactions: the one to the metrics stuff? yeah took a look at those
7.3.2022, 10:07:17 - mikkael: for exit nodes there is strength in numbers and cooperation, its a scary world as a solo exit noder.

7.3.2022, 10:09:09 - mikkael: exactly
7.3.2022, 10:09:40 - suspiciousactions: so run more exits then...
7.3.2022, 10:10:59 - mikkael: network not sustainable with solo exit nodes, needs heroic cypherorgs

7.3.2022, 10:14:04 - suspiciousactions: if those normal ppl would just stop using this shitty clearweb, we would not have a problem with exits at all.
7.3.2022, 10:14:17 - TheAnonymouseJoker: So, what happened with AnonyPla?
7.3.2022, 10:14:55 - suspiciousactions: allegedly captured by russian forces, all keys and accounts compromised.
7.3.2022, 10:15:10 - TheAnonymouseJoker: ?????
7.3.2022, 10:15:16 - suspiciousactions: yeah.
7.3.2022, 10:15:28 - suspiciousactions: look in #bnonymity:matrix.org 
7.3.2022, 10:15:37 - TheAnonymouseJoker: That is a little out of nowhere... and sus
7.3.2022, 10:17:16 - suspiciousactions: build your own opinion there. I don't have anything more than some more or less (un-)educated guesses as to what happened really. This is off topic tho, so anything related to that pls over to #bnonymity:matrix.org. Also i would kindly ask to just calm all yo tits until the fog of war clears. Right now, nobody really knows anything for sure.

7.3.2022, 12:24:02 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): You can ask cryptography-specific questions in #moderncrypto:gnuradio.org
7.3.2022, 12:25:03 - grugoogaboog: I wasnt trying to be a smart alec but thats why I asked in different rooms I was explaining my rationale.
7.3.2022, 12:27:24 - toor: Would make more sense to just use stronger crypto
7.3.2022, 12:29:27 - toor: Current public key schemes will be broken if quantum computers actually become a thing. But with symmetric ciphers you can just double they key length to get the same security level as in current non-quantum threat model
7.3.2022, 12:30:13 - toor: So it's really the public key schemes that are the problem. But there are solutions for that being developed.

8.3.2022, 23:20:07 - mikkael: Follow lists?  Not sure what you are referring to but it sounds like pre-made list of people?  If so, I have not seen one or would really want one.  Lots of open sources of meaningful information that don't require strip searches and phone numbers.  For example, I have followed Alec for many years and find him to be a well-meaning person with good intention, but neither he not I needed twitter for that to happen.

In the context of avoiding noise on Twitter or spending disproportionate time reading comments from ill-informed people, I think pre-made lists are helpful.
8.3.2022, 23:33:29 - mikkael: Take top people you follow on twitter, find their other outlets: repos, blogs, podcasts, forum, channels, books, and spider out from there.  You will find wider group of people, repeat regularly, remove noise.  The psa spaces list can be used as a starter.
8.3.2022, 23:34:50 - mikkael: from the guide alone you can probably find 100+ projects, leads, groups, communities that are all available (and _better_ available) without need of twitter. 
8.3.2022, 23:36:29 - paciento üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: Yeah, that's what I tend to do.
8.3.2022, 23:46:51 - mikkael: Wider more open sources also helps avoid bubbles.  I think its important to spend time "reading comments from ill-informed people" or at least thoughts and comments that challenge your current position.  But I think platforms like twitter and others limit this to shouting and memes vs dialogue.  We have survived thousands of years of discussion without needing to be tagged and tracked like cattle to do so (phone numbers etc), and privacy people encouraging and trumpeting such platforms is disappointing.

Whether the data is encrypted or not doesnt matter in many ways.  metadata and netflows etc are often just as useful.

10.3.2022, 01:07:29 - bkilm: The weak point in this is that the whole toolchain and runtime libraries would also need to be formally verified and many recent trendy languages lack such a proof.
10.3.2022, 01:10:42 - bkilm: By the way, do note that formal verification is about verifying whether certain mathematically exact statements hold true through the execution of the implementation. This can be an invariant, some kind of liveliness, deadlock-resistance or capability based access properties. You would generally not just say that something had been "formally verified" - you would have to state **which properties** were shown to hold.
10.3.2022, 01:12:43 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Yes, although it's worth noting that "formal verification", when unqualified, refers to security restrictions enforcement

All other modern FP languages have an optimizing compiler that is too advanced for any kind of proofs . It would be interesting to reimplement a compiler or interpreter (perhaps for a subset of the language) just for the sake of being easy to work with in this aspect.
10.3.2022, 09:48:01 - bkilm: Property based testing is something that FP languages brought in, though https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck
10.3.2022, 09:49:44 - bkilm: And for all intents and purposes, in real life engineering, testing coverage (or even TDD) and the maintainability of tests ares considered more important for most classes of software than providing proofs for every line of code.

10.3.2022, 23:33:20 - bkilm: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_stack_fingerprinting for others tracking you ever over the WAN. But one within your LAN can track you on many levels starting from nanosecond timing profiles to wireless capability fingerprints or MAC TSF based clock skew/jitter pinning. And if your threat model involves a real adversary, the analog waveform of your wifi card is so unique, it is trivial to profile you within just a few microseconds using very cheap accessories, probably within a few hundred dollars using an SDR.
10.3.2022, 23:33:30 - mikkael: Sure, all kinds of ways.  Hostname leakage, ntp leaks, the time-of-day it sees you passing/connecting, ordering/timing of how you connect, clock/load leaks, captive portal choice, tcp timestamps, sequence numbers, variation in header sizes from things like padding, traffic after connecting (even if encrypted), mtu I imagine, many others etc.  Only few bits to reasonably identify someone in a small set like 'myAP users', and much can be done with just passive sniffing.  Try it yourself, ignore mac address and wireshark 2-3 devices on your network, you will be able to identify which is which quickly.
10.3.2022, 23:34:55 - bkilm: Ah yes, they can actually recover your system clock skew/jitter (that runs from a different oscillator than the wifi card) as well using timing the repetition rate of your higher level events.
10.3.2022, 23:36:07 - bkilm: And if you ever sniffed the air you would see how the various platforms, cards, OS and drivers differ in their behavior about probing, channel schedule, initial association, initial DHCP burst timing and repetition.

In online world and especially on activism it's very hard to know how things will go. Even close people can backstab you.  But with anonymous profiles, I've got a bunch of friends, of course SWIM. Whom do it very simply. They always rotate identity, they might have multiple pre-warmed identities, old ones are just disposed. And they'll never talk about what they have done before. So every discussion and identity starts from fresh. Of course this approach got big positive and negative sides.  Pro is that it makes tracking "you" harder, when you always keep on topic, never discuss anything outside it and use multiple parallel identities and limit exposure.
12.3.2022, 05:55:08 - SamLeh: This is exactly why I dislike any "privacy" communication application which doesn't allow "unlimited new and parallel identities". I don't want to use same identity to talk to my dad or sister, which I use to talk to Mossad, CIA and KGB... ;) Just kidding, but I guess everyone gets the point.

12.3.2022, 06:49:33 - SamLeh: <@mikkael:halogen.city "Russian military busy chasing tr..."> This all depends on available resources. I've encountered this problem often when working with small team against huge team. The huge team uses lot of resources for things which we think is incredible waste of time. But the big team got lots of people which are hired to do exactly and only that. So it might not be obvious for them that every request from that non-essential task team made to us just reduces our resources to deal with the essential tasks.
12.3.2022, 06:54:41 - SamLeh: With some projects and online communities it's very important to avoid some questions and topics. Because very friendly guys might be talking about the subject, but if you think about it closer. It might be just espionage or preparing to blackmail you.
12.3.2022, 06:57:57 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): I'd like to add that many people here underestimate the importance of AnonyPla's guide. Anonymity is a massive threat to oppressive governments - thr first thing any oppressor tries to do it setup a spy network. The guide stands for everything they hate - freedom to express your true opinion
12.3.2022, 06:58:48 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): I in no way find it surprising that this community would be targeted in attempt to create distrust or eve to use AnonyPla's identity to spead misinformation
12.3.2022, 07:00:25 - SamLeh: Babba27, yes the guide is awesome. But for us whom been dealing with these threats and corporate security for decades it hardly provides anything new. Yet it's very nice and compact presentation with easy to grasp approach. 
12.3.2022, 07:01:42 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Exactly. It makes it possible for people to protect themselves while speaking their true opinions, without doing years of research to study privacy/security/anonymity like it's a profession
12.3.2022, 07:02:21 - mikkael: I've never been described as a friendly guy, but point taken Sam :)  o7

Losing the seed would be catastrophic but I think people are getting used to the tools and process to manage them quite well from crypto space.  The benefits for unconnectable unlimited new identities using established tech, tools, and hw (coincard, offline signing, mutlisig, etc) would be pretty neat and fit well with something like briar, signal. ....

12.3.2022, 07:28:52 - SamLeh: <@mikkael:halogen.city "Have often thought about using s..."> For the use case I described, bip32 isn't right solution or any deterministic method. I especially asked for non-connected identities. So it has to be fully random. And for sure there are many ways to generated seemingly unconnected identifiers from seed. But I'm generally cautious about that kind of solutions because those aren't then truly unconnected. But not going into details. I just would (and do) avoid it.
12.3.2022, 07:29:46 - mikkael: if they could be connected crypto would end.
12.3.2022, 07:30:19 - mikkael: so its a strong (provable) incentive to believe it works.
12.3.2022, 07:30:20 - SamLeh: Those can be connected in case of compromise, just like Babba27 said. 
12.3.2022, 07:31:09 - SamLeh: When I said get rid of "all trace", I did mean it. If the past identities are recoverable arithmetically then it's a total disaster. 
12.3.2022, 07:32:11 - SamLeh: mikkael: I do run TRNG hardware, just for that. Otherwise I could just use sha256(b'mysecretstuff') hashes for "random".
12.3.2022, 07:34:02 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): <@sl:envs.net "This is exactly why I dislike an..."> Recently I've been finding myself becoming more and more enthusiastic about Qubes, for this exact reason. I can have as many identities as I want, as I can just setp a new AppVM for each identity
12.3.2022, 07:34:36 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): I can also wipe each AppVM independently, or wipe my entire system all at once, by deleting my LUKS headers from dom0

12.3.2022, 07:38:19 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): There's also the issue with different identities becoming correlated post-compromise, even if they use independent key material. Running multiple identities on the same system without VMs is a recipe for disaster long-term

12.3.2022, 07:45:21 - mikkael: you missed my manifesto rant.  above was joke.

Even a commit that fixes a typo will weight in the megabytes this way... They should only be uploaded as the latest GitHub release asset or uploaded to github.io by the CI/CD. I don't see the benefit of signing the source files by a single person periodically vs. signed git commits (as that's the decentralized alternative), but you could still sign the uploaded assets.
12.3.2022, 11:23:43 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): I did it this way because I find it easier to work with, and if the guide goes down, every git mirror contains the entire toolchain ready-to-use
12.3.2022, 11:26:42 - @bkil:matrix.org: I don't like solutions where everyone will be force pushing the repo all the time due to space reasons. This is the opposite of transparency by being able to review the change history directly.
12.3.2022, 11:28:03 - @bkil:matrix.org: And also, if you just include a CI/CD configuration for some common hosts (github.io actions. gitlab.io, bitbucket, drone, etc), Anybody who forks the guide can enable Pages with just a click. Heck, gitlab (and maybe others) automatically enable Pages instantly if they notice the CI/CD config file in the repo!
12.3.2022, 11:28:36 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): Howso? You can see the original files, as well as the entire process I use to build everything

17.3.2022, 15:46:29 - toasterbirb: I think you could apply basic password cracking to it. If your string is less than 7-8 characters, it could be brute forced with good enough hardware. I'd assume strings longer than that should be more than enough
17.3.2022, 15:47:36 - Sean: okay that's what I thought but like does seeding it with more entropy make it more secure?

17.3.2022, 15:50:43 - Sean: well I mean ethereum uses sha256 for it's private keys
17.3.2022, 15:51:13 - Sean: I think most clients hash a 7 or 8 word seed phrase

17.3.2022, 16:18:22 - 0xbad1dea: They actually make functions for hashing passwords, called PBKDF or password-based key derivation functions. They intentionally slow down the hashing process (usually just iteratively hashing over thousands of iterations) to prevent hashcracking. Doesn't stop rainbow tables, but that's what a salt is for.

17.3.2022, 20:12:54 - 0xbad1dea: <@sl:envs.net "0xbad1dea: Yet if the password i..."> But that's not how hashing functions work. You don't get better protection against hash cracking by saturating the input space, you get it by being less predictable or brute forceable. PBKDFs make brute force harder by increasing the compute time. No one can save you from a predictable password though.
17.3.2022, 20:15:32 - SamLeh: 0xbad1dea: If you saturate the input space, it means that in theory PBKDF becomes totally pointless. Whole point of hash cracking is the weak passwords. If passwords would already have saturated input space, then there's no point of trying to even find the password. You can directly go and start brute forcing the cipher key. (Of course this only in case, where the hash is then used as cipher and encryption key).  Also password hashing is pointless, if you just use random key with the cipher anyway.
17.3.2022, 20:18:05 - 0xbad1dea: "Saturating the input space" insofar as you make a longer password will make it harder to crack the hash, yes. It won't make it harder to crack from an algorithmic perspective, cryptographically secure hash functions are intended to protect variable length inputs from being reversed, hence the one way function, regardless of their length
17.3.2022, 20:18:43 - 0xbad1dea: Pbkdfs are specifically intended to take a weak password and make a strong key
17.3.2022, 20:19:03 - SamLeh: <@0xbad1dea:warmitup.chat "Pbkdfs are specifically intended..."> I know, but why use weak passwords if you don't have to.

17.3.2022, 20:21:04 - SamLeh: That's valid point, you don't need to, or shouldn't. And using PBKDF in most of cases does perfect sense, because the passwords are weak, as we all know. But if we already use totally random 256 bit key for example with AES256, why we need hashing at all? I think most of apps actually totally skip that hashing part. Didn't bother to dig any proof, but I just think it doesn't make sense.

AnonPla came back on after ~1 week and verified herself to Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla). She said that she was raped and it is evident that the credentials weren't transfered to the intended person taking over in time.
21.3.2022, 11:38:52 - Dobe Johnson: That's roughly what happened ^
21.3.2022, 11:43:39 - Dobe Johnson: From what I remember, she didn't verify herself to EVERYONE as all her cryptographic keys have been stolen by the Russian military. She only verified herself to Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): through means that are up to Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏èAnonyPla): to disclose if they want.

22.3.2022, 12:02:06 - Dobe Johnson: asialeone68: anyway, using offline password storage protects against attackers even better than bitwarden (even if it is self hosted) but you only need to switch to keepassxc if your threat model needs it
22.3.2022, 12:11:34 - asialeone68: so choosing keepass i wouldn't be able to use on the go, like on mobile, right?
22.3.2022, 12:11:48 - asialeone68: all data will be stored encrypted on my laptop?
22.3.2022, 12:18:46 - Dobe Johnson: Yep, but you shouldn't be conducting sensitive activities on your phone. You can still use bitwarden for your phone or other stuff but use keepass for secret stuff
22.3.2022, 12:21:28 - asialeone68: i was reading some stuff, looks like with bitwarden password are stored encrypted on cloud.
So my thought is: isn't better to have them stored encrypted on cloud rathen than on my laptop?
22.3.2022, 12:22:42 - asialeone68: i would assume my reaction on a laptop theft would be less efficient than bitwarden ( assuming both are using encryption)
22.3.2022, 13:28:28 - asialeone68: probably not the right room
22.3.2022, 13:28:47 - asialeone68: however i'm going to try
22.3.2022, 13:31:25 - asialeone68: as i said i am migrating from spark mail ( worst choice) -- from mail ( apple ) -- from thunderbird. 
With spark i didnt have problem with cache size, with mail however the size of mail app is keeping grow due the fact it store email.
with thunderbird i am reading some stuff to prevent that. 
So, with imap does make sense to have all the email local?
With spark i hadnt experienced slowness retrieving mail when need it
22.3.2022, 13:31:41 - asialeone68: so can i disable evertying? I looking this

22.3.2022, 21:51:43 - jbschirtzinger: WHONIX has a better idea concerning how they move the IP through it.
22.3.2022, 21:51:44 - jbschirtzinger: or they did.
22.3.2022, 21:52:16 - jbschirtzinger: I figured somebody would have mastered the two USB stick whonix/tails combo by now.
22.3.2022, 21:52:43 - silly-goose-420-69: Having the tor connection isolated in its own VM and the tor browser itself (which can be disposable) running in its own VM is kinda a nice added layer or protection. No concern over decloaking attacks 
22.3.2022, 21:53:07 - jbschirtzinger: Yeah, I know people like tor. I never have trusted it fully.
22.3.2022, 21:53:16 - jbschirtzinger: I mean, I'm not doing anything that I care if the world sees.
22.3.2022, 21:53:22 - jbschirtzinger: but it's the principle of the matter.
22.3.2022, 21:53:23 - silly-goose-420-69: likewise
22.3.2022, 21:53:48 - jbschirtzinger: I think I2P is a better solution than TOR but it doesn't get the same kind of funding it seems that TOR does.
22.3.2022, 21:54:11 - silly-goose-420-69: Yea I havent even been on I2P in years. Feel like I should check it out again

24.3.2022, 20:25:21 - sararhodes: pretty much every provider of any service will have the data that was requested by the french. They need to have it for analysis of security events and for network monitoring. Plus some countries require some level of data retention. this is all in their user agreement so its not really a sell out. Plus if you're  Opsec is good and you're using encrypted mail....the French had essentially junk.

24.3.2022, 20:47:50 - mazerfaker: literally every service in every country around the world would have to comply with smth like this

It won't work via tor in safest mode anymore someone maybe has abused it. I reaaaalllly wooonder who that person is lmaoo. But still pretty secure, solid, serious email provider. No interpol no nsa no nothing just fully secure email inbox with lot's of functions. Cheers.

I would never and i say it again never use protons services. Justmy standing do what u wan't. Cheers.

PGP is good RSA espacially did proof it for a long time ECC is new but i would also trust ECC. Quantum Computation is the real threat here. But hey just use a messenger that emcrypts your messages with AES and wait send only pgp messages. Boom 2 layers and that's more than enough. If you don't trust wickr me fully but a bit. Just send pgp if wickr holds to their sayings your secure anyway and if they don't your secure too lol.

25.3.2022, 09:16:49 - toasterbirb: And that's the thing. The users don't usually hear from these if the orders are coming from a government entity
25.3.2022, 09:17:16 - toasterbirb: it could count as evidence tampering if they let the user know, or maybe in some cases they can let the user know that something is up
25.3.2022, 10:07:39 - SamLeh: I love solutions which do not get and or store data, so there's nothing to deliver. As example, dnskv.com follows this idealogy. No source, no destination, no identity, it's just key and value. And no logs.
25.3.2022, 10:08:16 - mazerfaker: you would be forced to collect the data
25.3.2022, 10:09:06 - mazerfaker: Oooh so you mean like that
25.3.2022, 10:09:31 - mazerfaker: as in the whole protocol is "trustless"

Yes then ofc, that should be the goal
25.3.2022, 10:09:51 - SamLeh: Exactly. Requests also come via proxy, so even if I would have log, I wouldn't know the real source / destination, just like with Tor. - `dig txt my-msg.dnskv.com`

25.3.2022, 13:19:36 - BaikaAllures: Yeah,some whilr ago they basicly sold out but, dont get me wrong its a good provider have good interface but for someone who want privacy and security it does not worth using it, from my pov proton its one of the best alternatives for gmail and other stuff, and if you will say that they gived one ip adress that is not sold out yk xD proton is still a good provider, but have in mind that no email provider its the most secure or idk, email in general was not build for security xD every email provider have flaws 
25.3.2022, 13:19:43 - BaikaAllures: Soo  yeah xD

25.3.2022, 13:21:55 - BaikaAllures: Find the best point in each email provider and use it for the right thing

25.3.2022, 13:23:21 - toasterbirb: if you don't login to it for about half a year (IIRC) they will close your account and you basically locked out at that point
25.3.2022, 13:23:40 - toasterbirb: so if you forget to login to that email for a while, you might get locked out of some accounts if you want to change the passwords
25.3.2022, 13:23:59 - toasterbirb: protonmail from my understanding doesn't close inactive accounts

8.4.2022, 09:13:23 - SlickRick: If a system is completely secure aside from a hardware keylogger, I assume it would have no networking capability and must write your key strokes on to a storage that must be retrieved to be read. Is that accurate?
8.4.2022, 09:14:04 - SlickRick: Is the best way to prevent / detect a hardware keylogger to have robust tamper detection on the laptop itself?
8.4.2022, 09:15:06 - SlickRick: I'm reading an article by Micah Lee on theintercept.com about evil maid style attacks.
8.4.2022, 09:15:13 - SlickRick: Message deleted
8.4.2022, 09:15:22 - SlickRick: > An attacker could completely replace your laptop with a different laptop of the same model ‚Äì they could even put your real laptop case with all your stickers and scratches on the fake laptop, so that it looks exactly the same. When you type your passphrase into this one though, it could send that passphrase over the internet to the attacker, who could then use it to unlock your real disk.
8.4.2022, 09:15:30 - SlickRick: This is very interesting^
8.4.2022, 09:17:55 - SlickRick: That would be a brilliant LE move to gain access to encrypted volumes as a last ditch evidence gathering portion of an operation. I suppose a safeguard against such an attack, besides physical tamper detection, would be a secondary strong password beyond the LUKS layer to prevent free access beyond the initial disk encryption password.
8.4.2022, 09:18:13 - SlickRick: Of course boot attestation via HEADS would be another.

12.4.2022, 08:13:10 - boberts29292992: I heard that session is good but people keep saying that since it doesn't implement forward secrecy it makes it so that it isn't as private compared to other messengers that do have it. I then asked people in the session community room on session if forward secrecy is neccesary for session and they said that it isn't so I am a bit confused on if session is viable or not as a private messenger
12.4.2022, 08:29:57 - neo_sodom: Hard to tell since an attacker would need physical access to your device first. I don't know your threat model but mine does not include an adversary with those capabilities. Also, pfs is about security not privacy.
A solution for that would be to use self-destructive messages and I already have that with Briar

14.4.2022, 15:31:04 - toasterbirb: It could very well be possible that she has lost access to the internet. Then again, it really isn't clear how much delay was there in the dead man's switch timer
14.4.2022, 15:32:14 - @allures:matrix.org: Well babba probably knows all the thruth but she will not tell us, she knows more than us 
14.4.2022, 15:32:28 - @allures:matrix.org: Not probably, i'm sure 
14.4.2022, 15:33:49 - darlatan: then there is this https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonypla
14.4.2022, 15:33:58 - darlatan: and this https://keybase.io/anonymousplanet
14.4.2022, 15:35:37 - darlatan: <@allures:matrix.org "Well babba probably knows all th..."> Why not? We could help
14.4.2022, 15:36:26 - darlatan: I have friends in Poland and Romania
14.4.2022, 15:36:45 - darlatan: They can help if she crossed the border
14.4.2022, 15:37:14 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "Why not? We could help"> There is a big secret
14.4.2022, 15:37:37 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "I have friends in Poland and Rom..."> Well i didnt meet her yet soo
14.4.2022, 15:37:56 - @allures:matrix.org: I dont think that 
14.4.2022, 15:37:58 - darlatan: I had a few DMs with her on Twitter 
14.4.2022, 15:38:49 - darlatan: I even donated some XMR to her
14.4.2022, 15:38:52 - @allures:matrix.org: Id think that will help,  she was a paranoid,  that explain few things (babba sayed that ) 
14.4.2022, 15:39:09 - @allures:matrix.org: Babba is lying 
14.4.2022, 15:39:16 - @allures:matrix.org: And anonypla too
14.4.2022, 15:39:29 - @allures:matrix.org: Babba slipt few things out 
14.4.2022, 15:39:33 - darlatan: lying? you mean hiding their real identity?
14.4.2022, 15:39:42 - @allures:matrix.org: About everything 
14.4.2022, 15:39:59 - darlatan: everything?
14.4.2022, 15:40:17 - toasterbirb: Just don't turn this into a conspiracy theory
14.4.2022, 15:40:05 - darlatan: you think the whole thing is a hoax?
14.4.2022, 15:40:09 - darlatan: seriously?
14.4.2022, 15:40:21 - neo_sodom: It's just an identity we don't know
14.4.2022, 15:40:23 - darlatan: someone would write a 160 pages guide and then just destroy it?
14.4.2022, 15:40:33 - darlatan: are you kidding?
14.4.2022, 15:40:46 - darlatan: do you have any idea how much work she put into that thing?
14.4.2022, 15:40:53 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "someone would write a 160 pages ..."> You're week with you're thinking, i like anony bc of her power of thinking xD 
14.4.2022, 15:40:59 - @allures:matrix.org: <@darlatan:matrix.org "do you have any idea how much wo..."> Yes
14.4.2022, 15:41:04 - @allures:matrix.org: She wasnt destroyed 
14.4.2022, 15:41:25 - darlatan: Yes because she made archive.org copies at each release
14.4.2022, 15:41:49 - @allures:matrix.org: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "Just don't turn this into a cons..."> This is the thrut, babba is lying, something smell bad 
14.4.2022, 15:42:19 - toasterbirb: <@darlatan:matrix.org "someone would write a 160 pages ..."> Destroy what? Can you tell me what has been destroyed?
14.4.2022, 15:41:56 - darlatan: This guide is pure gold 
14.4.2022, 15:41:57 - @allures:matrix.org: xD
14.4.2022, 15:42:12 - darlatan: And btw we should definitely tell Ukrainians to use Briar
14.4.2022, 15:42:14 - @allures:matrix.org: I'm 100% sure babba is lying and she knows everything 
14.4.2022, 15:42:15 - darlatan: actively
14.4.2022, 15:42:22 - @allures:matrix.org: Yeah true 
14.4.2022, 15:44:18 - toasterbirb: <@allures:matrix.org "This is the thrut, babba is lyin..."> Can you elaborate any further

14.4.2022, 15:43:43 - darlatan: all that remains is that github account, that hackernews account and that keybase account
14.4.2022, 15:45:45 - toasterbirb: <@darlatan:matrix.org "all her accounts, the website, t..."> You can click the link in the room description, grab a PDF and continue with your day. I don't see any issues with that
14.4.2022, 15:46:46 - toasterbirb: Also, what would you do to your own accounts if you were in the risk of being captured
14.4.2022, 15:47:04 - darlatan: because I care for good people
14.4.2022, 15:47:26 - toasterbirb: Running some website is the last thing in your mind when someone is knocking to your door with a glock
14.4.2022, 15:47:26 - darlatan: obviously, you don't 
14.4.2022, 15:48:26 - @allures:matrix.org: <@toasterbirb:halogen.city "Can you elaborate any further"> Yes i can, but i will not do that, i let you guys think and see the thruth with you're eyes,  now that we talked that she might preoare now xD 
14.4.2022, 15:48:29 - toasterbirb: I'm not undermining her work. Don't get me wrong. I just can't understand the brewing conspiracy theories recently in this room that make the situation look like a fucking TV drama
14.4.2022, 15:48:31 - @allures:matrix.org: Soo good luck
14.4.2022, 15:49:36 - toasterbirb: Well, that statement was bunch of air if something
14.4.2022, 15:50:04 - @allures:matrix.org: I meant babba not anonypla xD 
14.4.2022, 15:50:19 - @allures:matrix.org: Is not a tv drama , the reason is simple 
14.4.2022, 15:50:25 - @allures:matrix.org: Just bad hide 
14.4.2022, 15:51:14 - darlatan: look look look 
14.4.2022, 15:51:41 - darlatan: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonypla
14.4.2022, 15:51:55 - darlatan: it was updated just now 
14.4.2022, 15:52:09 - darlatan: like 5 mins ago it wasn't there
14.4.2022, 15:52:11 - darlatan: same message
14.4.2022, 15:53:00 - neo_sodom: That is true. It was not there the last time I checked. But as it said, it was probably automated
14.4.2022, 15:53:19 - darlatan: she has a server somewhere hidden running scripts trying to post messages on all her accounts
14.4.2022, 15:53:58 - toasterbirb: probably a github action or something with a timer 
14.4.2022, 15:53:46 - darlatan: the exact same message
14.4.2022, 15:54:05 - neo_sodom: <@darlatan:matrix.org "she has a server somewhere hidde..."> And that proves what?
14.4.2022, 15:54:41 - darlatan: mmmmmh
14.4.2022, 15:55:17 - neo_sodom: Except what toaster wrote
14.4.2022, 15:55:25 - darlatan: I think it's legit because I see absolutely no reason to doubt it. I wouldn't write 160 pages and then just trash it all away
14.4.2022, 15:55:44 - toasterbirb: In github you can create actions in a repo for free that run repeatedly with a cron job. She probably has it check for website visits and if there is none, the action will do something more than just sleep
14.4.2022, 15:56:23 - toasterbirb: Just jam bunch of API keys with no expiration date there and you have a script that can post stuff to multiple platforms
14.4.2022, 15:56:44 - neo_sodom: Its not trashed away since there is already a new maintained guide. It was just the easiest method to vanish without needing to elaborate further and justify herself
14.4.2022, 15:57:54 - toasterbirb: This just proves the point that guides like this need many more backups than just the ones made by the original creator
14.4.2022, 16:03:32 - skypass joined the room
14.4.2022, 16:04:51 - toasterbirb: <del>hmh... the hackernews profile just disappeared</del>
nvm its back up
14.4.2022, 16:04:54 - darlatan: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "Its not trashed away since there..."> why not just give away the account / organization / repository and domain instead of  just trashing it ?

14.4.2022, 16:05:51 - darlatan: I have an HN account

14.4.2022, 16:07:13 - toasterbirb: Do you see my edit?
14.4.2022, 16:07:20 - toasterbirb: The page was blank for a while
14.4.2022, 16:07:25 - darlatan: meh ... makes no sense to me 
14.4.2022, 16:08:07 - darlatan: her vanishing coincidentally happened exactly when the Russians closed in on Kyiv 
14.4.2022, 16:08:44 - darlatan: my take? she's an activisit
14.4.2022, 16:08:45 - neo_sodom: Coincidentally ... because it was planned
14.4.2022, 16:08:47 - darlatan: activist
14.4.2022, 16:08:58 - darlatan: and she got pwned by the Russians
14.4.2022, 16:09:09 - neo_sodom: Allegedly
14.4.2022, 16:09:14 - darlatan: yeah
14.4.2022, 16:09:34 - darlatan: but this message contain some information that maybe could prove it's legit to some people in here
14.4.2022, 16:09:59 - darlatan: I guess we need to wait for Babba27
14.4.2022, 16:11:16 - darlatan: Things she only said prior to some specific people
14.4.2022, 16:12:07 - darlatan: The youtube song tho ... good pick ...

14.4.2022, 16:12:37 - darlatan: Couldn't pick a better song for the situation
14.4.2022, 16:12:57 - darlatan: She has good music taste
14.4.2022, 16:13:59 - darlatan: <@allures:matrix.org "She will not cooperate :))))"> We'll see
14.4.2022, 16:14:23 - darlatan: All I want to know is if the gist is legit or not
14.4.2022, 16:14:43 - darlatan: if it is ... I'll send friends in Romania and Poland to look for her at the camps at the border 
14.4.2022, 16:14:47 - neo_sodom: The github account got compromised, why would you trust it
14.4.2022, 16:15:03 - darlatan: <@neo_sodom:matrix.org "The github account got compromis..."> Hope

14.4.2022, 16:15:57 - @allures:matrix.org: If babba dont ban us for off topic, you can ask her about everything you want but will not help 
14.4.2022, 16:16:23 - @allures:matrix.org: As you see the rooms are dead from basicly anony's vanish 
14.4.2022, 16:17:17 - @allures:matrix.org: Babba dont have the mental strenght to manage something, nor thinking good, she knows a lot in privacy security and stuff but she is down very down with thinking xD 
14.4.2022, 16:17:47 - neo_sodom: That said, please move the discussion to #bnonymity:matrix.org everyone
14.4.2022, 16:17:51 - @allures:matrix.org: As a normally person,  she is abnormal xD not in a good way xD

14.4.2022, 16:21:53 - toasterbirb: It could be that there was an API key active that wasn't revoked that gave her still some access to the account

14.4.2022, 19:05:32 - hv: This room and the corresponding guide was created with the intention of more people being capable of evading such bad circumstances. Presumably anony only had an issue due to her having to expand her attack surface for the convenience of using so many platforms and running some infrastructure, plus also using a long-term psueodnym
14.4.2022, 19:06:01 - hv: Instead let's ask the new lurkers if they have any questions
14.4.2022, 19:06:02 - hv: Do you?

14.4.2022, 19:06:44 - darlatan: this is not off-topic ... as far as I understand AnonyPla/Lena is the founder of this place no? trying to help her is not off-topic 
14.4.2022, 19:08:30 - darlatan: anyway they'll be there in 3 hours
14.4.2022, 19:08:38 - hv: Do you even know where she is?
14.4.2022, 19:09:25 - darlatan: they'll look for a 22yo Ukrainian "Lena"
14.4.2022, 19:09:48 - toasterbirb: In an area spanning hundreds or thousands of kilometers?
14.4.2022, 19:10:14 - darlatan: no they're all in a big camp in the town of medyka at the polish border
14.4.2022, 19:10:26 - darlatan: the red cross probably has a registry 
14.4.2022, 19:12:31 - hv: larp stuff man. you don't even know if this isn't the usual "anonymous person runs project for x amount of time and terminates ungracefully" thing that happens sometimes
14.4.2022, 19:13:19 - hv: and that github message was allegedly automated, which could mean anything, not just direct threat
14.4.2022, 19:14:29 - darlatan: possible but I'll try ... is there anything to lose trying ? 
14.4.2022, 19:15:06 - darlatan: it's worth a shot
14.4.2022, 19:25:15 - darlatan: I don't know what LARP means

14.4.2022, 19:28:37 - darlatan: I joined this matrix thing today just for the purpose of finding information about her whereabouts
14.4.2022, 19:37:13 - darlatan: Does anyone has any information about her? Anything?
14.4.2022, 19:37:29 - darlatan: Besides what's in that "possibly fake" message
14.4.2022, 19:38:25 - toasterbirb: Absolute no clue. She was as mysterious as someone who would write an Anonymity guide would be
14.4.2022, 19:39:09 - toasterbirb: She liked to add ... a tonne into her messages, if that's something
14.4.2022, 19:39:19 - darlatan: a tonne?
14.4.2022, 19:39:26 - darlatan: what's a tonne?
14.4.2022, 19:39:30 - toasterbirb: Yea, like literally every third line :D
14.4.2022, 19:39:33 - darlatan: sorry I'm french
14.4.2022, 19:39:46 - toasterbirb: tonne as in 1000 kilos, "a lot"
14.4.2022, 19:40:02 - darlatan: oh literally a ton okay
14.4.2022, 19:40:23 - darlatan: that won't help
14.4.2022, 19:40:33 - toasterbirb: Like that is not proof that you are talking to her, but I guess it was quite notable thing about her writing style
14.4.2022, 19:40:41 - darlatan: I need information about her like languages spoken or something for instance?
14.4.2022, 19:42:52 - darlatan: right now I got girl, 22, dark curly hair, first name Lena, Ukrainian refugee from Kyiv, likely wounded, probably traveling alone without any personal belonging
14.4.2022, 19:44:48 - darlatan: so my friends will head to the field hospital of MSF first
14.4.2022, 19:46:36 - darlatan: then red cross, then polish army field hospital
14.4.2022, 19:47:30 - darlatan: as far as I know, there are no other field hospitals there at the moment
14.4.2022, 19:53:00 - darlatan: is there any polish speaker here?
14.4.2022, 19:55:28 - darlatan: Someone speaks Ukrainian?
14.4.2022, 20:13:06 - mazerfaker: okay, please go back to off topic. This went for waaayy too long than it has to
14.4.2022, 21:55:53 - paulux23 joined the room
14.4.2022, 21:56:01 - paulux23: Hello !! Please I need your help. 

 I am an activist and I need to access some government websites.

 Tor IP are banned, that's why I only use a VPN ( Express VPN, no log VPN bought with btc and a protonmail email adress. ). Moreover, Javascript is needed, that's why I have to enable Javascript. I also need to download files. 

I have tried once to access it threw Duckduckgo but it did not work. Maybe it was not because of Duckduckgo, but that's why I'd prefer to use Google if it's not an issue. 

As a consequence, I usually try to access these websites with : Express VPN ( IP and DNS server ) + Firefox "incognito mode"  with javascript enabled, Webrtc disabled and https + Google + Internet on a router / on my phone with the localisation / bluetooh disabled. I can also buy prepaid chips in you tell me it's necessary.  Then, I download pdf files. 

However, I have red that javascript, flash and downloading pdf files could leak my IP adress even if I use a VPN. Is it true ? Is it my public IP adress / something which can make them see who I am ?  Moreover, could you please advise me on I could do to remain anonymous ?? 

Thank you very much in advance !! 
14.4.2022, 22:17:54 - paulux23: In short : 

How can my anonymity be broken if I use a no log VPN bought in bitcoin + Firefox "incognito mode" https with javascript enabled but Webrtc disabled + Google ( not connected to my account ) + internet on a router with a prepaid chip ? ( I am an activist, I can't use Tor, javascript is necessary and I have to download pdf). 
14.4.2022, 22:18:54 - toasterbirb: IP leaks are usually caused by DNS or IPv6 issues with the VPN-client, but I don't think JS and downloading files risks any IP leaks assuming the VPN connection is system wide
14.4.2022, 22:19:39 - paulux23: Thank you for your answer, I use the DNS of my VPN and I have checked that there is no DNS leaks. Moreover I don't use Ipv6. 
14.4.2022, 22:20:18 - toasterbirb: Have you deliberately disabled IPv6? Websites use it automatically if its available
14.4.2022, 22:21:45 - toasterbirb: I remember having leaks with IPv6 and ProtonVPN client without even noticing it. Dunno if they have fixed it and also don't know if there are similar issues with other VPN services.
14.4.2022, 22:21:53 - paulux23: My vpn does not use it 
14.4.2022, 22:22:07 - paulux23: okay I ll check though 
14.4.2022, 22:22:42 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "My vpn does not use it "> That is the thing. It might just let IPv6 go trough your regular connection
14.4.2022, 22:23:21 - toasterbirb: You can usually disable IPv6 on the router level or in your firewall settings etc.
14.4.2022, 22:24:07 - paulux23: Ok I ll check it 
14.4.2022, 22:24:22 - toasterbirb: Also when it comes to JavaScript, you don't have to decide if you want to block everything or nothing. You can whitelist scripts one by one until you reach the minimum required functionality
14.4.2022, 22:26:07 - paulux23: Oh how can I do this ? 
14.4.2022, 22:26:14 - paulux23: WIth firefox ? 
14.4.2022, 22:26:22 - paulux23: Moreover can it leak my public IP ? 
14.4.2022, 22:26:28 - paulux23: even with a VPN ? 
14.4.2022, 22:32:20 - toasterbirb: <@paulux23:matrix.org "Oh how can I do this ? "> I use the NoScript addon
14.4.2022, 22:32:46 - toasterbirb: It is in the Tor browser by default
14.4.2022, 22:34:58 - paulux23: Okay, and can't the noscript addon disclose my activites if requested by a government ? I am indeed an actisit 
14.4.2022, 22:35:13 - paulux23: I can't use Tor browser as Tor IP are banned on the website I visit

15.4.2022, 00:58:09 - hv: They also dropped blockchain on it for some reason, and I'm not really sure why. If they want you to stake some crypto to join a p2p network to prevent spammy / sybil actors, fine- I fail to see why that would require a NEW cryptocurrency, rather than using existing ones like Monero or something.

Think about it- if they really wanted to do this, they could fork just Tor and turn it into a decentralized pay-for-bandwidth scheme
15.4.2022, 02:03:28 - SlickRick: paulux23: I believe you can use tor browser without routing your traffic through the Tor network. This will provide the fingerprinting defense etc. of the browser.

15.4.2022, 02:05:03 - SlickRick: If it is only infrequently to download things etc. you should be looking at using public wifi where you aren't expose to surveilance cameras. You can use wifi-extenders to be further away and get on the wifi.
15.4.2022, 02:05:57 - SlickRick: If you do that, or connect to public wifi in any way to do this, you will want to randomise your MAC address, which is a unique hardware identifier of your network card in your computer that was set by the manufacturer. This is relatively easy to do, and you can look up how online.
15.4.2022, 02:06:50 - SlickRick: VPN's offer some protection, but they are not a great level of protection. Using public wifi where you can't be recorded and observed with randomized MAC + the VPN that isn't tied to you is a much better solution.
15.4.2022, 02:07:31 - SlickRick: If you paid for your VPN anonymously with cryptocurrency that is good, but if you are connecting to the VPN via your home network, it doesn't matter if you bought the VPN anonymously, you are tied to the VPN with your home IP.

15.4.2022, 02:08:39 - SlickRick: When you say a 'logless vpn', you need to be careful about claims these companies make which aren't auditable. Especially if you are staking your freedom on it. Some will say they don't log, and log, and others will log on request. I've seen Mullvad VPN touted as a more reliable VPN, which can be purchased with Monero, a more private crypto.
15.4.2022, 02:10:07 - SlickRick: If you go online to a crypto exchange, and then use your bank or credit card to buy the bitcoin, then that bitcoin is linked to your name. It doesn't matter that the purchase was in BTC, they can look at the fact that x sent btc from this address, and he got that from y address, which is a big exchanges address.

Ok, so we will now request the bitcoin exchange to tell use who they sent .3btc to at blah blah time, and they have you.
15.4.2022, 02:10:38 - SlickRick: Monero is better about shielding your identity, which makes purchasing Mullvad via Monero a better choice. if you go to moneros site, they don't sell it via Monero themselves, but they have resellers who sell you 3months worth for Monero, so look for them.

hv Can you expand on this for a smooth brain like myself? You are saying that is creating a fingerprint of traffic? Just don't get the 'more vantage points' aspect. Perhaps you are saying that you are giving a unique activity fingerprint through a whole bunch of nodes across the network and thus casting a wide net of that fingerprint activity, some of which will be malicious?
16.4.2022, 06:46:48 - SlickRick: paulux23: It's not safe. You need to understand that it is better than your home IP, but it's not 100%
16.4.2022, 06:47:19 - SlickRick: VPN's lie all the time. Mullvad is the most trusted i've seen, but I wouldn't even trust them, because all their incentives are to tell the public what they want to hear, and then log to be able to comply with legal requests that might otherwise ruin their business
16.4.2022, 06:48:09 - SlickRick: paulux23: Do you know what a tor bridge is?
16.4.2022, 06:48:37 - SlickRick: Btw, just to be clear, if you actually want to achieve anonmity it is going to take a bit of learning & research. There is no 'here, use this VPN, bada bing bada boom, you're safe'
16.4.2022, 06:49:04 - SlickRick: A Tor bridge is a way for people to connect to the Tor network in countries that actively censor Tor.
16.4.2022, 06:49:36 - SlickRick: You are FAR FAR FAR safer using tor than express VPN
16.4.2022, 06:49:39 - SlickRick: LEAGUES safer
16.4.2022, 06:50:17 - SlickRick: Trusting Express VPN is like trusting a condom well past its used by date. It's probably better than nothing but don't be shocked if you get a phone call 9months later asking for you to come and give DNA
16.4.2022, 06:51:44 - SlickRick: paulux23: From Tor's website on bridges

"Bridge relays are Tor relays that are not listed in the public Tor directory.

That means that ISPs or governments trying to block access to the Tor network can't simply block all bridges. Bridges are useful for Tor users under oppressive regimes, and for people who want an extra layer of security because they're worried somebody will recognize that they are contacting a public Tor relay IP address.

A bridge is just a normal relay with a slightly different configuration. See How do I run a bridge for instructions.

Several countries, including China and Iran, have found ways to detect and block connections to Tor bridges. Obfsproxy bridges address this by adding another layer of obfuscation. Setting up an obfsproxy bridge requires an additional software package and additional configurations."
16.4.2022, 06:52:27 - SlickRick: Tor bridges are specifically there for people trying to accesss Tor where it is censored.
16.4.2022, 06:52:57 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet joined the room
16.4.2022, 06:54:23 - SlickRick: paulux23: Its possible for you to connect to whatever resource you need in a safe way, but it takes covering your bases and going through some things. So start with researching what is a Tor bridge, and also watch some youtube videos on what is Tor if you don't really understand why it is so much safer than a VPN. Then come back here & ask questions.
16.4.2022, 06:55:07 - SlickRick: paulux23: https://anonymousplanet-ng.org/guide.html also have a look at some sections of this guide
16.4.2022, 07:21:13 - @sophia1992:tchncs.de joined the room
16.4.2022, 07:47:39 - hv: So you're sending a particular pattern of bandwidth through the network. So there's already `(badentry/goodentry) * (badexit/goodexit)` probability of a network-level adversary being capable of correlating your traffic for a given circuit. If someone actually went through with that meme, they would just be increasing the chances that this bad actor can monitor that particular circuit. Enter and exit 4 times, then it's 4 times easier to monitor your circuits, and that doesn't bode well over time.

Think- so adversary can't monitor your entry stream, but they see the exit stream. Imagine you actually followed through with that meme, and made an entirely new circuit from some new machine, and the second circuit they can monitor the entry but not the exit. Suddenly your pattern is appearing in more places and is more likely to be matched
16.4.2022, 07:49:54 - emulationdepression: would you say that it is less anonymous than just regular tor?
16.4.2022, 07:50:00 - hv: Oh, and that's optimistically assuming that this 'tunnel more tor circuits over each other' meme is actually using different guards for these separate circuits on different machines, which it wouldn't be probably, unless you altered Tor's source code or had machines make circuits for yuo
16.4.2022, 07:50:23 - SlickRick: Thanks for taking a moment to explain. I didn't really read the specifics of the meme chain so going up & re-reading it with your context makes sense.

16.4.2022, 07:50:53 - hv: If you wanted more relays so badly, you would just change the code to increase the circuit length, which you can do

16.4.2022, 07:52:48 - hv: I think that I2P supports users just manually changing circuit lengths, as well as users restricting some or all of their route to 'trusted' relays if they really want. If you were really going for the 'le 7 proxies' thing maybe you'd start there. That network is also comprised of machines that are more diverse geographically, far more likely to be home computers
16.4.2022, 07:52:59 - SlickRick: I still have a lot to learn about proxies & chaining. I get the basic threats of fingerprinting & malicious entries & exits, but things like the debate about adding a VPN in etc. I still have an insufficient conceptual understanding to really plot it out in my head
16.4.2022, 07:53:33 - hv: The bummer is that I2P has no exit nodes, unless you intentionally put a SOCKS proxy software on some machine running as a hidden service on it
16.4.2022, 07:54:28 - hv: Some people on that network run their own exits that exit through Tor, which means that they are going through 9 proxies and still not complicating it by going through the same network twice
16.4.2022, 07:55:25 - hv: Even though that network has more relays than Tor it has WAY less bandwidth flowing through it than Tor, since their users are also relays, rather than just volunteers (thus inflating the number)
16.4.2022, 07:56:54 - SlickRick: Woah
16.4.2022, 07:57:14 - SlickRick: I'll research i2p now. I've just heard of it in passing.
16.4.2022, 07:57:45 - hv: I was confused about it despite talking to the devs about it in their IRC for a while
16.4.2022, 07:58:15 - hv: I'm not sure I really comprehend all of their slew of traffic analysis measures and whatnot
16.4.2022, 07:58:31 - hv: I can give you the gist of it though
16.4.2022, 08:25:34 - hv: So underlying both Tor and I2P is the concept of onion routing, which you probably already understand. Users have TLS between them and their relays, relays have TLS between each other, and inside those connections, size-padded cells are sent with three layers of encryption. Supposedly I2P does something to bundle messages together or whatever, but I could never get a straight answer out of them as to wtf they meant by that.

Differences:

- **No exit relays**, so you don't enjoy the clearnet without putting in extra effort. This is the worst part of their network and the thing that really makes it far less useful than it could be.
- All users are relays, so more relays, more geographic diversity, relays are much less likely to be hosted on datacenters. Also this creates background noise which may outright hide smaller traffic- i have not seen a study on that, so don't rely on such a thing.
- No central authority. This means less need to trust, but also means that the network is opened to new possible attacks like 'eclipse attacks' that try to affect the peers' views of the network. So peers have to use heuristics and have friction against change, measure each other, not use peers from the same /16 subnet in a circuit and other behavior to make this difficult and less effective.
- **Unidirectional circuits**- you have a different circuit for inbound and outbound traffic, doubling the amount of network visibility that an adversary has to have in order to gain the same information about your connection.
- Applications can play with circuits a lot- they can make 'pools' of inbound or outbound tunnels with more than 1 tunnel, to balance load. They have the _option_ to make/use shared tunnels, which multiple applications could use at once instead of having their own. They can shorten (good for filesharing) or lengthen tunnels, add potential random hops.
- The network is slower because it's running on peoples' residential connections, and geographic diversity means many poorer users as relays as well
- No long-lived entry relays. All relays are just relays, though IIRC there may be some kind of logic to be 'attached' to using some pool of peers for a length of time, to slow things down like the Tor idea of guards does. This may not be true, I'm not sure lol.
- Publishing of hidden services and negotiations of their connection is somewhat different
16.4.2022, 08:28:24 - hv: So there's some give and take. Some benefits of design decision, some potential weaknesses. However, I think that their worst flaw is the choice to not do exit relaying. The main appeal of anonymous networks is to anonymously access the ***Internet***, after all, and because you can't do that by default, their network gets far less attention, funding, research, users, developers, than it could
16.4.2022, 08:36:56 - hv: anonypla liked (likes?) saying that everyone like ourselves gets fascinated with i2p temporarily for some reason, and then stops being so fascinated.
16.4.2022, 08:37:29 - hv: she's right. I think it's the fact that the ideas of that network are so cool, it's all a very interesting thing that obviously has potential, but the lack of exit nodes is a total buzzkill
16.4.2022, 08:41:05 - SlickRick: Thanks for breaking that down for me. You rule. Those are some really interesting concepts, but you say the architecture of I2P not having exit relays prevents clearnet connections?
16.4.2022, 08:41:18 - SlickRick: Everything stays within the network?
16.4.2022, 08:41:41 - SlickRick: Unidirectional circuits sounds very interesting.
16.4.2022, 08:42:32 - hv: The idea of unidirectional circuits is that, if someone wants to be able to watch both your in/out streams to correlate traffic, they have to have double the visibility to have the same amount of data they would with bidirectional circuits
16.4.2022, 08:42:34 - SlickRick: The point about the network bandwidth due to users being relays as opposed to a lot of servers is interesting & problematic. That's both a feature & a bug.
16.4.2022, 08:42:42 - hv: Oh also I think i2p supports UDP
16.4.2022, 08:43:00 - hv: a bunch of the users are file sharers
16.4.2022, 08:44:00 - hv: <@karlq:matrix.org "Thanks for breaking that down fo..."> Yes. Of course you could get a box, start proxy software listening on a local port, and bind that to a server tunnel (they even have neat GUIs for setting up tunnels), but that requires controlling some machine to do this on
16.4.2022, 08:44:04 - SlickRick: How do hidden services work on a network like I2P then if the network is really running of transient user relays?
16.4.2022, 08:44:14 - SlickRick: Can you also set up a server with it?
16.4.2022, 08:44:32 - SlickRick: Tbh I should go and read about how Tor hidden services work, then come back and ask.

16.4.2022, 08:45:06 - hv: Tor hidden services are actually really simple to explain, at least on a simple level
16.4.2022, 08:45:26 - hv: A tor hidden service is two tor clients using their circuits to talk to each other

17.4.2022, 14:38:18 - mazerfaker: So wait

We are talking about a regular proxy that you use in conjunction with HTTPS (the sites you connect to)

if it were to be, say, CF reverse proxy then yes, it does do TLS termination but how exactly does a HTTP proxy do it? Assuming we do not install any certificates or anything. All we are doing with a HTTP proxy is relaying, practically the same thing your ISP does
17.4.2022, 14:38:38 - mazerfaker: >CF reverse proxy then yes, it does do TLS termination

Which I believe you even have to use their own certificates
17.4.2022, 14:39:17 - mazerfaker: how will the proxy decrypt the traffic that is coming if it is directed to wikipedia.com, and can only be decrypted by them

Of course this varies greatly, but I've seen so many VPNs where they're only authenticating the client. And or use fixed shared string secret for authentication like 00000000.

18.4.2022, 01:09:51 - hv: <@jau2o-dk45a3:artemislena.eu "didnt understand what you meant ..."> I mean that since the underlying routing and DNS infrastructure underpin authentication, you can't use PKI to encrypt connections to do with PKI
18.4.2022, 01:10:11 - hv: Like CA's have to check that a server owns a domain before issuing a cert right?

18.4.2022, 01:11:00 - mazerfaker: I never done it, and never really looked it up on how you do it, but I think its just posting some kind of record
18.4.2022, 01:11:55 - hv: The only defense against this I can think of, would be trying to route through multiple 'perspectives' of the global internet infra, which might increase the difficulty of doing it via BGP rerouting- but perhaps not. I'm not well versed in this kind of attack obviously

18.4.2022, 07:51:04 - SlickRick: > All this certificate discussion lead to one funny thought, that many VPNs actually use very very bad authentication from server side. They're only interested if the customer is paying, so client is authenticated. But the server authentication sometimes is basically non-existent. Of course this varies greatly, but I've seen so many VPNs where they're only authenticating the client. And or use fixed shared string secret for authentication like 00000000.
SamLeh This is a good point & something I had briefly pondered recently.
18.4.2022, 07:52:45 - SlickRick: > SlickRick: I would say practically no, there's no difference. Yet, I wonder often WHY "VPN" is so important, when even HTTPS / SSH will do it. Ie encrypt communication with the host you want the data to be kept private. Yes, there's some metadata leak, but is that really so important (in normal use cases).

SamLeh Yes Sam I know your very valid take on VPN's. I am in the process of rapidly expanding my knowledge on such matters, and it would not surprise me if I altered by current approach in a few months based on an improved understanding.

What I meant there that the added decryptioni and re-encryption in https proxies would add overhead = slow things down.

However as I corrected myself, the TLS termination does not need to happen in https proxies, which means that there is no decryption and re-encryption, thus no overhead that you'd have to worry about (no more than any other type of proxies)

19.4.2022, 06:27:34 - toasterbirb: You can use the work profile for some isolation
19.4.2022, 06:29:55 - toasterbirb: If you want to make a virtual machine though, there's one option: Install Termux and setup some Linux proot in it (Arch Linux ARM for example). You don't need root access for proot. Then after that you can run X11 server with XServer XSDL app and run some sort of lightweight desktop environment in it in the Arch Linux proot. You should then be able to run QEMU quite easily in the proot distro and install Android X86 into it
19.4.2022, 06:30:08 - toasterbirb: Its certainly not going to run well at all, but its doable :D
19.4.2022, 06:30:29 - toasterbirb: I have done this with Windows 2000 on my own Android phone as a proof of concept

19.4.2022, 06:51:20 - toasterbirb: I guess that would be different. What I did was basically just run 2 proot systems inside of another and then put QEMU i386 on top of that
19.4.2022, 06:52:13 - toasterbirb: You could in theory take out the Arch part from in some cases depending on the architecture of the VM. Termux has some QEMU packages

Found what I was looking for, will be testing soon @samleh
19.4.2022, 13:22:49 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: Trasnparent proxies are not so transparent though, you'd still need to configure the client to talk to the proxy, on a per application-basis (which is very annoying in my experience) or you could set it in your firewall, or router.
19.4.2022, 13:24:48 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: Then authentication and authorization can also be a concern, Squid implements a password auth method which I am not a fan of
19.4.2022, 13:26:37 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: A VPN is more transparent in that regard imo, plus the added encryption.
19.4.2022, 13:29:14 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: Vpns are just another method of proxying and are nothing new (which doesn't justify the hype imo), and are just another implementation of the process of proxying traffic.

19.4.2022, 18:09:35 - SamLeh: No you don't need to configure end devices, because true transparent proxies are middle boxes which intercept the traffic, those can be configured as the default gateway for the whole network. All traffic passes by the proxy, without any additional device configuration.
19.4.2022, 18:13:52 - SamLeh: As example, uh one environment, uses exactly such. To inspect and log all HTTPS traffic and checking for data leak prevention (DLP). That was one of the reasons which slowed even HTTP/2 implementation a lot, because it was harder to handle by the transparent proxies.

19.4.2022, 18:56:40 - rhospix: Anyone here use Orbot on an Android device (Graphene) in full-device VPN mode (with block connections without VPN)?

I'm unable to use Tor Browser or Briar with this configuration.

Trying to start Tor Browser fails, and causes Orbot to get stuck in "Starting" mode.

Briar just fails to make connections.

I think this is some Tor-over-Tor stuff but, as far as I can tell, Orbot should explicitly allow those two applications to pass through (I'm running the latest Orbot 16.6.1-RC1)
19.4.2022, 18:56:59 - rhospix: <@rosejohna1:matrix.org "how are u"> Living the dream. ;) Yourself?

19.4.2022, 18:59:27 - toasterbirb: They haven't interfiered with eachother at all
19.4.2022, 19:00:04 - rhospix: Are you picking individual apps (rather than leaving it as "Full Device VPN")?
19.4.2022, 19:00:12 - toasterbirb: I don't have **everything** routed trough Orbot though
19.4.2022, 19:00:12 - rhospix: I'd rather not have to remember to opt in for each app.
19.4.2022, 19:00:16 - toasterbirb: yea I pick individual apps
19.4.2022, 19:00:28 - toasterbirb: I think it opts in by default
19.4.2022, 19:00:30 - toasterbirb: I can check
19.4.2022, 19:04:00 - toasterbirb: It doesn't seem to opt in automatically
19.4.2022, 19:05:17 - toasterbirb: I'd probably also use full device VPN, but my schools admin got a bit annoyed with it because their logs scream at them due to my location changing all the time
19.4.2022, 19:06:00 - toasterbirb: I think it was school email

Default policy is always deny first and then allow if on whitelist. And the whitelist is usually short or extremely short, like small set of hand picked ip addresses / subnets.

19.4.2022, 20:18:48 - SamLeh: Whole point is that you can't use HTTPS to siphon secrets out of the system, if triggered there will be alerts and all traffic gets blocked.  Also all traffic which the proxy can't decrypt and inspect, is blocked as well. - But that's nothing special, almost everyone using services behind Cloudflare get exactly the same treatment, Cloudflare works just as reverse inspecting proxy.

I use lot of strong challenge response systems, but let's say I need to verify in situation where I'm robbed and naked, well then I don't have access anymore to the authentication data, because it's impossible to remember such stuff. Especially if you haven't needed it for years. But of course the scheme could be simpler and easier to remember and based on something you'll anyway know and the knowledge is shared between key group of people. As in case some technical stuff, deep knowledge of some topic subject is quite hard for outsider to master easily, and it's something that can't be easily transferred in interrogation. Also such topic can be used to easily indicate duress, when you can obviously wrong answers which aren't obvious to everyone. So they know it's not right.
20.4.2022, 06:33:37 - entry1: Why are we believe that someone posting anonymity tips online would be taken by the govt. Is there any real proof this person exists?
20.4.2022, 06:34:08 - entry1: Not trying to sound like an absolute dick, but this seems like larping
20.4.2022, 06:34:22 - entry1: Not trying to troll, I am serious
20.4.2022, 06:36:43 - SamLeh: entry1: Well it depends, people usually has some reason why they're interested about anonymity and security. Whatever it is for people. For some it might be job, for others hobby, for some others a key to their business which the business would be terminated immediately and so on. Who knows. 
20.4.2022, 06:38:01 - entry1: Seems like someone trying to erase their ties to the identity/pseudonym and coming up with an elaborate larp. If I'm completely wrong, I'm happy to shut up

20.4.2022, 06:44:15 - SlickRick: entry1: I doubt larping on the part of the individual themselves, I think the level of dedication to the guide would suggest a LARP like this is an unlikely but possible occurance.
20.4.2022, 06:44:43 - SlickRick: I think most likely is an attempt to burn an identity, and some weirdos using it to LARP & play with the drama & emotion by being 'the one who knows the info' or faking being anonypla
20.4.2022, 06:44:56 - SlickRick: We will see
20.4.2022, 06:45:20 - SlickRick: Ohh sorry I guess I agree with your take, I suppose when I think of LARP i think of more troll type, rather than a deliberate misinformation effort
20.4.2022, 06:46:08 - SamLeh: Kind of out of context and topic. But it wouldn't be first time when online communities see crazy people with elaborate operations to do something. Sometimes those really get silly... I've ssen a few amazing ones during the online decades starting from 90's...

21.4.2022, 14:45:54 - toasterbirb: Well, apparently you already were in a field hospital according to him

21.4.2022, 14:46:14 - toasterbirb: but still, I can't understand how you were moved from there if you were comatose
21.4.2022, 14:46:18 - toasterbirb: that still sounds like a kidnapping to me
21.4.2022, 14:46:41 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): no ... it sounds like "assisting a person in danger"
21.4.2022, 14:47:08 - toasterbirb: A random person appears to the scene. Knows the first name and the hair color and they simply let them take you?
21.4.2022, 14:47:18 - toasterbirb: Don't you think there a risk for issues in that?
21.4.2022, 14:47:29 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): They're cops
21.4.2022, 14:47:38 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): Not random people
21.4.2022, 14:47:40 - toasterbirb: cops with no authority there
21.4.2022, 14:47:43 - toasterbirb: he said it himself
21.4.2022, 14:47:46 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): yes
21.4.2022, 14:47:48 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): exactly
21.4.2022, 14:48:08 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): and he made sure I was on a plane
21.4.2022, 14:48:11 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): I think
21.4.2022, 14:48:13 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): I guess
21.4.2022, 14:49:10 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): because I don't have a passport
21.4.2022, 14:49:12 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): nor a visa
21.4.2022, 14:49:20 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): nor anything
21.4.2022, 14:49:30 - toasterbirb: you don't need those if you are ukrainian at the moment
21.4.2022, 14:49:30 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): and yet here I am in Germany now
21.4.2022, 14:49:39 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): no questions asked
21.4.2022, 14:50:00 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): yes you do, you don't know what you're talking about
21.4.2022, 14:50:06 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): you need to register
21.4.2022, 14:50:08 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): you do need ID
21.4.2022, 14:50:12 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): you do need papers
21.4.2022, 14:50:23 - toasterbirb: There are countries taking in Ukrainian refugees with no Visa etc.
21.4.2022, 14:50:26 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): you don't just "get into the EU" like that
21.4.2022, 14:50:46 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): they'll require identification and stuff
21.4.2022, 14:51:03 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): and that's just in one town in Poland
21.4.2022, 14:51:09 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): getting on a plane to Germany is a whole other deal
21.4.2022, 14:51:23 - toasterbirb: Sure
21.4.2022, 14:52:22 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): Some cop coming to your bed and giving you a free computer
21.4.2022, 14:52:29 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): that's a whole deal
21.4.2022, 14:52:33 - toasterbirb: The whole thing will still stay a mystery. You yourself asked firmly to not ask any questions about your ordeal, so it wil stay as mystery as long as that stands. The whole thing sounds like a movie script at the moment and will probably stay like that to the end of time. I guess it doesn't matter in the end though since you are back
21.4.2022, 14:53:20 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): I'm just saying many people here were unhelpful to someone just trying to help
21.4.2022, 14:53:41 - NotSoAnonyLena (awake, aka AnonyPla): and actively unhelpful
21.4.2022, 14:53:43 - toasterbirb: What if the person wanting to help had bad intentions
21.4.2022, 14:53:55 - theShadow: for me the reason I can never believe this would be real is the whole behaviour absolutely contradicts any anonymity related rules... Now you even use your real name... Sorry but it is too much unprobable.
21.4.2022, 14:53:59 - toasterbirb: he had no credibility here
21.4.2022, 14:54:13 - theShadow: the person who builds this guide and all and then breaks it all

21.4.2022, 14:59:05 - toasterbirb: I'm not telling you at that point because I'm comatose. Should I be waiting for someone online to doxx my location so some rando can come in and pull the plug while I'm in the hospital?

23.4.2022, 03:35:53 - SlickRick: Ok, please inform me.
23.4.2022, 03:37:15 - madaidan.: Verified boot needs to be a complete chain to be meaningful, starting from an immutable hardware root of trust. You can't just mix and match steps; any gaps in the chain will make it useless.
23.4.2022, 03:37:28 - SlickRick: AnonyPla (the return): HEADS is a BIOS you hardware flash on to your SPI ROM chip and hashes the boot stack (so /boot kernel etc.) and uses the TPM (trusted platform module) to store these measurements in the TPM PCR registers, you sign them with your key, and use a hardware token to verify them on boot to enusre no tampering.
23.4.2022, 03:37:34 - madaidan.: Nothing will stop an attacker from simply replacing the firmware itself. 
23.4.2022, 03:37:53 - SlickRick: But then the measurements are changed which alerts
23.4.2022, 03:37:59 - SlickRick: It's not to secure the system, it's to detect tampering.
23.4.2022, 03:38:02 - madaidan.: Everything must be signed and verified for it to work.
23.4.2022, 03:38:15 - SlickRick: You are assuming a threat model in your position here
23.4.2022, 03:38:32 - SlickRick: You are right, there are roots of trust in the manufacturing & where the laptop came from before you
23.4.2022, 03:38:46 - SlickRick: But it still gives you a chain of trust over your boot stack after the point where you set it up
23.4.2022, 03:38:59 - SlickRick: Nothing you said refutes the value in that, and it also protects against software kernel persistence

23.4.2022, 03:40:01 - SlickRick: AnonyPla (the return): Following on from that, HEADS has a TOTP in it that allows the authenticity of the HEADS installation to be verified to you via a Hardware based token (Nitrokey, librem key) that shares the secret on HEADS, and when you boot it checks that time based code to ensure HEADS itself hasn't been modified

23.4.2022, 03:40:41 - AnonyPla (the return): but okay
23.4.2022, 03:40:51 - SlickRick: madaidan.: That's what the TOTP is for. HEADS verifies itself to you.
23.4.2022, 03:40:59 - SlickRick: via your hardware token
23.4.2022, 03:41:13 - SlickRick: with the shared secret & time increment that was established when you set it up
23.4.2022, 03:42:04 - SlickRick: What flaw do you see in that which would allow the firmware to be replaced underneath you?
23.4.2022, 03:42:20 - madaidan.: Heads is still only 1 part. There are many bits and pieces that make up the boot chain. All must be verified.
23.4.2022, 03:42:24 - SlickRick: AnonyPla (the return): Sorry. See osresearch.net for details, then the github.
23.4.2022, 03:42:38 - SlickRick: Ok so you now see the firmware can be verified.
23.4.2022, 03:43:07 - SlickRick: How can those pieces up the chain be modified if the BIOS kernel /boot initrd are attested?
23.4.2022, 03:43:18 - SlickRick: I don't think you understand HEADS as well as you initially indicated.
23.4.2022, 03:43:29 - madaidan.: A meaningful verified boot implementation starts from an immutable hardware root of trust (i.e. the boot ROM) that verifies the firmware which then verifies the kernel and that verifies user space parts of the OS.
23.4.2022, 03:43:54 - madaidan.: <@karlq:matrix.org "Ok so you now see the firmware c..."> That's not what you've explained at all.
23.4.2022, 03:44:13 - SlickRick: HEADS does start from the boot rom? HEADS first verifies itself to you via TOTP on the hardware token
23.4.2022, 03:44:42 - SlickRick: I don't claim to be an expert & so I am very interested in your criticisms.
23.4.2022, 03:45:27 - SlickRick: You then have measurements taken of the /boot files, kernel, initrd etc. that are hashed, those hashes are then compared with the hashes stored in the PCR registers of the TPM
23.4.2022, 03:45:29 - madaidan.: <@karlq:matrix.org "HEADS does start from the boot r..."> That makes no sense. The boot ROM is, by definition, unmodifiable and Heads cannot be flashed to it.
23.4.2022, 03:46:10 - SlickRick: Ok I will go read about the boot ROM. As I said I am not an expert so perhaps there is an aspect of that chain that I haven't encountered.
23.4.2022, 03:46:34 - SlickRick: I thought the SPI flash chip is where the bios is, and that you can flash the chip & put heads on it
23.4.2022, 03:46:38 - madaidan.: <@karlq:matrix.org "You then have measurements taken..."> That doesn't matter either when all other privileged user space OS components are completely unprotected.
23.4.2022, 03:46:38 - SlickRick: Not sure where this immutable code is
23.4.2022, 03:47:07 - madaidan.: Why do I need to modify the kernel when I can just tamper with your init system and get effectively the same result?
23.4.2022, 03:47:14 - SlickRick: init is measured
23.4.2022, 03:47:20 - SlickRick: & verified
23.4.2022, 03:47:29 - madaidan.: No, it's not.
23.4.2022, 03:47:33 - madaidan.: Init != initrd
23.4.2022, 03:47:41 - madaidan.: Init is a user space program
23.4.2022, 03:47:41 - SlickRick: Ok ty. I will go do some research on this.
23.4.2022, 03:48:29 - SlickRick: As i said I am not arguing against you as such, just pushing to ensure I understand the root of your criticism isn't in something I am able to refute. Ty.

23.4.2022, 03:48:49 - madaidan.: Look at how verified boot works in Android/iOS.
23.4.2022, 03:48:55 - madaidan.: That's how it should be done.
23.4.2022, 03:49:17 - SlickRick: Ahk, I understood that it was the SPI chip that upon initial power up was what executes the first code.

24.4.2022, 09:06:37 - dngray: and there are reasons why that is, but yeah.
24.4.2022, 09:08:22 - dngray: if what was being attempted was identity rotation, it's been a pretty poor attempt
24.4.2022, 09:08:38 - dngray: identity rotation requires cutting ties with previous identities

24.4.2022, 09:23:00 - dngray: and yes, if you are rotating identities, you don't *hand things over to a friend who is not me promise*
24.4.2022, 09:23:33 - dngray: there are ways to identify facts about people, particularly based on how they speak.
24.4.2022, 09:23:44 - dngray: that's very difficult to fake, with long-term stable identities
24.4.2022, 09:24:36 - dngray: anyone trained in spotting those kinds of things won't be fooled with enough writing
24.4.2022, 09:25:28 - dngray: also, when people have compromised identities, they typically don't divulge more information about themselves such as, name, age, location, etc.
24.4.2022, 09:25:47 - dngray: and none of what is on that site has been verified irrefutably by third parties.

24.4.2022, 09:26:47 - dngray: and you're giving people a head start by providing some connection between the two
24.4.2022, 09:27:10 - dngray: that's why going dark with an identity literally means it goes dark (immediately), not grey, and then dark, and then another one comes online lol.

24.4.2022, 09:47:02 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: Identity deletion, possible. 

To another mod in the community, I'd doubt it, makes no sense
24.4.2022, 09:48:00 - dngray: the only logical reason for doing it, is that the original owner didn't want to give up all their friends.
24.4.2022, 09:48:10 - dngray: or wanted to continue activities they did under their first identity
24.4.2022, 09:48:38 - dngray: anything is possible, but probability of it being convincing is what I'm discussing
24.4.2022, 09:50:47 - dngray: other thing is, maintaining multiple identities simultaneously is risky, time consuming, and tiring.

24.4.2022, 10:02:36 - dngray: which was posted on Fri, Mar 4 2022
24.4.2022, 10:07:41 - dngray: Alexa,SaveThePlanet: can you spot the interesting things?
24.4.2022, 10:09:26 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: remove it tho
24.4.2022, 10:10:31 - dngray: can, do, but yeah, there's a few things there.
24.4.2022, 10:11:01 - dngray: especially when you consider that its doubtful a native to Kyiv would spell it "Kiev" i've noticed that has always been forever after corrected
24.4.2022, 10:11:10 - dngray: and if you look at news articles from the https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/kyiv-ready-to-fight-as-russian-forces-close-in-ukraine-capital
24.4.2022, 10:11:20 - dngray: > The UK Ministry of Defence said on Saturday morning that ‚Äúthe bulk of Russian ground forces‚Äù were around 25km from the centre of Kyiv, while the cities of Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Mariupol remain encircled and continued to suffer heavy Russian shelling.
24.4.2022, 10:11:29 - dngray: so not sure how they are "500 meters" away
24.4.2022, 10:12:08 - dngray: does not make sense that earlier they would be closer
24.4.2022, 10:14:02 - dngray: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kyiv_(2022)#Second_Russian_attack_(28_February_%E2%80%93_4_March_2022)
24.4.2022, 10:16:13 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: <@dngray:polarbear.army "so not sure how they are "500 me..."> she was clearly not doing a report yk
24.4.2022, 10:16:51 - dngray: just seems like a weird little thing to be in there.
24.4.2022, 10:17:35 - dngray: especially for someone on the ground, who would have specifics like "we're being shelled" or something like that.
24.4.2022, 10:17:47 - dngray: rather than specific measurements, 500 meters is an irrelevant detail

24.4.2022, 10:19:05 - dngray: indeed
24.4.2022, 10:19:42 - dngray: there are also forensic linguistic analysis tools these days available to law enforcement that make the process more statistical too

24.4.2022, 10:20:04 - dngray: agreed
24.4.2022, 10:20:24 - dngray: in fact, if we're correct, it might be an "early warning" to this person they're not fooling anyone so yeah

24.4.2022, 12:38:55 - bashar234: I have questioned many people in DM
24.4.2022, 12:39:07 - bashar234: dngray: are you still here?
24.4.2022, 12:56:07 - boberts29292992: Which is a more secure and private messenger in the context of just sending messages to another user and why? The Conversations app with xmpp or Briar?
24.4.2022, 13:22:01 - michm joined the room
24.4.2022, 13:24:51 - dngray: <@boberts29292992:matrix.org "Which is a more secure and priva..."> briar for sure
24.4.2022, 13:25:10 - dngray: because XMPP servers have metadata about who is on your list, what messages you send and to whom
24.4.2022, 13:25:30 - dngray: XMPP is not a very private protocol at all in general
24.4.2022, 13:25:51 - dngray: and while it can be combined with OMEMO, and some XEPs that do VOIP encryption, not many client support that.
24.4.2022, 13:26:04 - dngray: so unless you're using conversations.im only, only really text  messaging is going to be encrypted
24.4.2022, 13:26:24 - dngray: for 1:1 communications and small group conversations, matrix is superior, to XMPP
24.4.2022, 13:27:38 - dngray: XMPP often gets confused by the privacy community for being somehow a privacy protocol
24.4.2022, 13:27:43 - dngray: when that was never really it's intention
24.4.2022, 13:28:34 - dngray: and tbh, if you're looking for ease of use, no metadata between contacts, (and not anonymity) even something like signal with sealed sender is far ahead
24.4.2022, 13:30:39 - dngray: its also very easy to block, as it operates on port 5222 usually
24.4.2022, 13:37:16 - dngray: <@bashar234:matrix.org "I have questioned many people in..."> doesn't really mean much, as nobody really knows who you are either.
24.4.2022, 13:37:25 - dngray: anonymous persons vouching for anonymous persons lol
24.4.2022, 13:38:11 - bashar234: <@dngray:polarbear.army "doesn't really mean much, as nob...">  dngray So I asked many people what and I got this:

- Hostile people were in Kyiv and she was living in northern outskirts/suburbs alone
- Her place was in building between Ukrainians and hostile people
- She was sleeping and they shot door open and used jamming device to disable cell phones
- They forced unlocking her laptop (this is when all got deleted)
- After 2 or 3 days ,those people got drunk and she escaped and ran to Ukrainians
- She received first aid from a medic but need doctor
- She was then on truck in group of 3 trucks to south west and she was in middle truck, all trucks full civilians and with red cross on top
- Last truck of convoy was destroyed next day by Russian plane
- Next day her truck was shot by Kalashnikov and people died in the truck and she got shot 
- Later she lost consciousness
- She arrived at Polish border at Medyka and was put into MSF field hospital
- She stayed there for 2-3 weeks
- Automatic message was posted saying that if that was posted she was in bad situation 
- A cop from Interpol in France (@darlatan:matrix.org) came here for informations and said he sent 2 polish cops to camp to look for her with description from automatic post
- They arrived 3-4 hours later and found one single person with description
- Next day was transported on polish military plane to Munich Germany hospital
- She was woken up days later and a german cop came and gave a tablet she used to try to contact family, friend and then came here
- Then she came every day and tried to prove identity which was in the end verified as legitimate by many
- She said the people who were after her were not Russian army but group of Chechnians
- Then she died during surgery

Sorry for my bad English

I don't see problemswith this story
24.4.2022, 13:41:00 - dngray: could all be an elaborate story lol
24.4.2022, 13:41:18 - dngray: nobody knows who you are, or the people you "talked to"
24.4.2022, 13:41:32 - bashar234: true
24.4.2022, 13:41:35 - dngray: and its kind of irrelevant
24.4.2022, 13:41:46 - dngray: what i find strange is the amount of effort put into setting a story
24.4.2022, 13:42:03 - bashar234: but ... why delete all then come back and try restore and then again go away ,
24.4.2022, 13:42:11 - dngray: rather than just say "hey guys, i've gotta go, and yes, I'm currently in Ukraine right now, things aren't good". /end of message
24.4.2022, 13:42:19 - dngray: the weird part i find is all the effort
24.4.2022, 13:42:36 - dngray: and all the seemingly personal details scattered throughout
24.4.2022, 13:42:57 - dngray: <@bashar234:matrix.org "but ... why delete all then come..."> attention, who knows
24.4.2022, 13:42:59 - dngray: maybe second thoughts
24.4.2022, 13:43:10 - dngray: maybe they missed their old identity.
24.4.2022, 13:43:16 - bashar234: yes she said different details to different people
24.4.2022, 13:43:19 - dngray: mental illness maybe too
24.4.2022, 13:43:23 - dngray: all these are plausible reasons
24.4.2022, 13:43:43 - dngray: <@bashar234:matrix.org "yes she said different details t..."> i could say i spoke to the pope yesterday, but can you check up on me?
24.4.2022, 13:44:13 - dngray: now a photo of me at the Vatican sitting down next to the pope, would provide credibility, though you'd have no way of knowing i am actually the person in the photo.
24.4.2022, 13:44:19 - paciento üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: #bnonymity:matrix.org
24.4.2022, 13:44:36 - bashar234: why "skeptical by default" ? or someone who wrote guide for more than 1 year
24.4.2022, 13:44:48 - dngray: the only reason i bothered to say anything is because you came into #lounge:privacyguides.org and were like "did you year the latest part in anonypla's story, she's dead"
24.4.2022, 13:45:03 - dngray: have no way of knowing if that is true
24.4.2022, 13:45:04 - bashar234: <@hypokeimenon:tchncs.de "#bnonymity:matrix.org"> I do not care
24.4.2022, 13:45:39 - dngray: <@bashar234:matrix.org "why "skeptical by default" ? or ..."> i have written for privacyguides for years but doesn't mean anything i say is "more true"
24.4.2022, 13:45:47 - dngray: its still a document produced by an anonymous person on the internet
24.4.2022, 13:45:50 - bashar234: I believe it is true 
24.4.2022, 13:46:00 - dngray: believe what you want i guess.
24.4.2022, 13:46:14 - bashar234: Truth will come out
24.4.2022, 13:46:21 - bashar234: Some day
24.4.2022, 13:46:29 - dngray: i just find it weird someone would release many sensitive and possibly identifying pieces of information about themselves, when in a situation of crisis
24.4.2022, 13:46:36 - dngray: you'd think that would be the furthest thing from their mind.
24.4.2022, 13:46:52 - bashar234: unless they think they will die
24.4.2022, 13:47:06 - dngray: and i say this clinically, if she were to die, would we know?
24.4.2022, 13:47:08 - dngray: no.
24.4.2022, 13:47:11 - dngray: that's the issue
24.4.2022, 13:47:25 - dngray: and would it even matter?
24.4.2022, 13:47:35 - bashar234: apparently that person of Interpol knows
24.4.2022, 13:47:40 - bashar234: and could prove
24.4.2022, 13:47:43 - bashar234: Darlatan
24.4.2022, 13:48:04 - dngray: > A cop from Interpol in France (@darlatan:matrix.org) came here for informations and said he sent 2 polish cops to camp to look for her with description from automatic post

did they prove they were
24.4.2022, 13:48:14 - bashar234: I'm trying to contact him
24.4.2022, 13:48:27 - dngray: i also find that unusual for law enforcement anyway
24.4.2022, 13:48:34 - bashar234: no luck 
24.4.2022, 13:49:07 - dngray: police would turn up to your residence and ask you for information directly, not go looking for people who they can't verify on the internet
24.4.2022, 13:49:10 - bashar234: there is a story that her work helped save someone important for Darlatan
24.4.2022, 13:49:42 - dngray: all these stories have one unanswered question, why would readers of an anonymity guide need to know these things?
24.4.2022, 13:50:01 - dngray: it reads like someone writing a spy novel, ngl, a badly written one.
24.4.2022, 13:50:06 - bashar234: It is said everything Darlatan do was unofficial
24.4.2022, 13:50:17 - dngray: yeah then i call bullshit
24.4.2022, 13:50:22 - bashar234: Maybe
24.4.2022, 13:50:29 - dngray: nothing police do is unofficial
24.4.2022, 13:50:38 - dngray: if they tell you they are police, then they are doing it as police.
24.4.2022, 13:50:48 - bashar234: But I am not so skeptical and I believe that story 
24.4.2022, 13:51:05 - bashar234: <@dngray:polarbear.army "nothing police do is unofficial"> Not in Poland
24.4.2022, 13:51:09 - dngray: sounds like someone trying to attain credibility by qualification, without providing anything in detail
24.4.2022, 13:51:19 - dngray: did they provide copy of their badge? with photographic ID?
24.4.2022, 13:51:37 - dngray: <@bashar234:matrix.org "Not in Poland"> what i mean is in context to investigation
24.4.2022, 13:51:43 - bashar234: nobody knows, MSF people would know?
24.4.2022, 13:51:49 - dngray: obviously they have lives outside of being law enforcement.
24.4.2022, 13:52:08 - bashar234: maybe someone can call MSF to check
24.4.2022, 13:52:23 - bashar234: say they are friends or family
24.4.2022, 13:52:51 - bashar234: MSF will not lie if this is true
24.4.2022, 13:53:14 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: <@dngray:polarbear.army "did they provide copy of their b..."> even if they did you  wouldnt believe it
24.4.2022, 13:53:30 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: plus its doxx who would dothat
24.4.2022, 13:53:53 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: why would they bother
24.4.2022, 13:54:10 - dngray: well precisely, there's no reason to believe.
24.4.2022, 13:54:37 - dngray: and the burden of proof is on the person claiming to be law enforcement
24.4.2022, 13:54:57 - dngray: after all they're trying to attain credibility from being associated with government organization
24.4.2022, 13:55:11 - dngray: which does provide motivation to be a lie
24.4.2022, 13:56:48 - bashar234: darlatan said here he used favors to do this work off the book
24.4.2022, 13:56:55 - bashar234: you can say you have doubt but why go to say it is false 
24.4.2022, 13:56:56 - dngray: anyway i think i've wasted enough time on this lol
24.4.2022, 13:57:17 - dngray: bashar234: personally i'd say you're invested in convincing people, which i find strange in itself
24.4.2022, 13:57:55 - bashar234: yes because I live in dictatorship
24.4.2022, 13:58:09 - bashar234: and guide helps me 
24.4.2022, 13:58:22 - dngray: aren't those two things irrelevant though?
24.4.2022, 13:59:00 - bashar234: No because I have debt
24.4.2022, 13:59:08 - bashar234: But I cannot explain
24.4.2022, 13:59:12 - bashar234: ...
24.4.2022, 13:59:20 - bashar234: She is a good person
24.4.2022, 13:59:45 - bashar234: or was
24.4.2022, 14:00:17 - bashar234: I do not see reason to discredit someone who spent so much time on this work
24.4.2022, 14:00:23 - dngray: none of those things are reasons for believing a specific narrative and trying to spread it in a community
24.4.2022, 14:00:41 - bashar234: Darlatan was right when he said people here do not care and are hostile
24.4.2022, 14:00:48 - dngray: nobody said anything about discrediting anyone
24.4.2022, 14:00:54 - bashar234: I saw he said that
24.4.2022, 14:02:52 - dngray: anyone can open matrix accounts and make them say things, that isn't evidence
24.4.2022, 14:04:08 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: <@dngray:polarbear.army "anyone can open matrix accounts ..."> why would anyone go to that length for gaining absolutely nothing ?
24.4.2022, 14:04:44 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: your critics are a bit overskeptical imo
24.4.2022, 14:04:48 - bashar234: It is obvious you never experienced war
24.4.2022, 14:04:52 - dngray: i gave you a reason lol

24.4.2022, 14:17:05 - grintea: i'm inclined to give this a pass (in isolation) due to hazy details, either due to not-entirely-accurate world reporting or due to unstable mental state of the person in question resulting in imprecise knowledge/communication, you know, being on the run and all. but taken with everything else, it is another weird piece on top of a bunch of other weird pieces

24.4.2022, 14:20:13 - bashar234: then I learned all this 
24.4.2022, 14:20:15 - grintea: like, how is it possible that the new admin was able to establish this elaborate sealed letter codeword scheme ahead of time (including the surgeon no less) to communicate to him whether or not lena died in surgery, but not think ahead enough to also communicate some harder proof, like a death certificate

24.4.2022, 14:22:46 - dngray: there are many examples of that in modern society
24.4.2022, 14:22:54 - bashar234: oh and she posted picture of her in hospital in a room but hiding face
24.4.2022, 14:23:02 - Alexa,SaveThePlanet: on the other hand, why would anybody bother giving any proof to a bunch of nerds, why would they show a death certificate etc...

24.4.2022, 14:28:36 - dngray: bashar234: image search likely would not show that image
24.4.2022, 14:28:43 - bashar234: people confirmed the equipment on the picture is german
24.4.2022, 14:28:44 - dngray: because the censored portion is big enough to give it a unique FP

24.4.2022, 14:29:58 - dngray: it really does not *prove* anything
24.4.2022, 14:30:20 - dngray: maybe that's the bed next to that bed.
24.4.2022, 14:30:38 - grintea: yeah i dunno, all this image proves is that they have an image of someone in a hospital with german equipment
24.4.2022, 14:30:55 - grintea: some of the preparation doesn't line up
24.4.2022, 14:31:43 - grintea: like the thing with the sealed letter and codeword with the doctor is really, really high-tier preparation, but they couldn't be bothered to do something like timestamp the photo with "lena, april 23" on paper or something
24.4.2022, 14:31:46 - dngray: just seems like a lot of "effort"

24.4.2022, 14:32:14 - dngray: but after hearing that i almost certainly don't believe there is any truth

voice of angels speaking to them, it‚Äôs aliens, George Washington, or John Lennon.

Every busy street corner has a chosen one, a mad prophet. They announce that ‚ÄúTHE END IS NIGH!‚Äù,
that humanity has been irredeemably condemned for its sins and misdeeds, ordering you to repent and
damning you to the eternal flames of hell. They frighten children and inspire a vague sense of pity in
adults‚Äî especially when you catch a whiff of their body odor as you pass. Yet they claim to be heralds of
the holy word.

27.4.2022, 02:14:23 - @spies:matrix.org left the room
27.4.2022, 02:32:33 - Scissortail: There's a search function where you can search the room for past Tails mentions but it takes patience.
27.4.2022, 02:32:54 - Scissortail: I just tried it looking for a CVE post I forgot the link to and it took 3 minutes.
27.4.2022, 02:33:04 - Scissortail: Needless to say this room is very large.
27.4.2022, 02:52:08 - trolljegeren: why don't you just go on the tails website?
27.4.2022, 02:55:34 - Scissortail: *no answer*
27.4.2022, 03:20:52 - SlickRick: trolljegeren: You can start by asking Babba why he verified 'Anonypla" was real when they showed up, then that individual he verified was Anonypla claims an interpol agent was in here who 'saved her', and then someone with the exact same username creates a github & claims they are taking over the guide & fundraising for her death, along with similar parts of their handle as Babba. That gets brought up, and suddenly the 100% verified annoypla disappears & deletes their accounts.
27.4.2022, 03:21:58 - SlickRick: Babba either is Anonypla or has agreed to take over running the guide through an alt personality that they agreed would show up after this poorly constructed killing of the Anonypla identity.
27.4.2022, 03:22:35 - Onessa: a Chinese team showed that they could paint invisible, tiny squares of infrared light on any face and cause a facial recognition system to think it was any other face:

27.4.2022, 03:23:38 - trolljegeren: SlickRick: We just talked to that interpol dude 
27.4.2022, 03:23:53 - SlickRick: How is his XMR fundraising effort for cremation going?
27.4.2022, 03:24:23 - trolljegeren: He told me any help would be welcome but it already happened and he paid for it
27.4.2022, 03:25:07 - SlickRick: Wow, that's great. And did he comment why he felt compelled to be the new maintainer of the guide?
27.4.2022, 03:25:15 - trolljegeren: You really think AnonyPla took more than a year to wrote those 160 pages for a 2000‚Ç¨ scam?
27.4.2022, 03:25:52 - SlickRick: No, I agree we have an interpol agent who is fundraising for cremation & also going to take over the "Hitchikers guide to anonymity". Makes sense.
27.4.2022, 03:26:16 - trolljegeren: No 
27.4.2022, 03:26:39 - Scissortail: Damn so AP is indeed gone?
27.4.2022, 03:26:47 - trolljegeren: He just wants to bring her remains to an IRL friend of her in the Netherlands
27.4.2022, 03:27:07 - trolljegeren: And then he just wants to find a way to contact her family which is behind Russian lines in occupied territory
27.4.2022, 03:27:13 - trolljegeren: That's it
27.4.2022, 03:27:16 - SlickRick: > Damn so AP is indeed gone?
Scissortail Either killed their identity & sloppy attempted to hand it to Babba or is still around and trying to take back over using alts
27.4.2022, 03:27:27 - trolljegeren: And also I verified that was indeed french
27.4.2022, 03:27:42 - SlickRick: Why did he start to do all that github work to take over the guide?
27.4.2022, 03:27:55 - SlickRick: Does he read the guide while he's on the toilet at interpol?
27.4.2022, 03:28:19 - Scissortail: AP never even hinted at leaving let alone for UKR.
27.4.2022, 03:30:08 - SlickRick: Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏è Lena): Why does 'Darlatan' the friendly matrix interpol agent / anon guide admirer have the same pronouns & (:dove: Lena) in their github as you?

27.4.2022, 03:31:53 - trolljegeren: <@karlq:matrix.org "Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSki..."> they don't ? 
27.4.2022, 03:31:59 - trolljegeren: Darlatan is just Darlatan
27.4.2022, 03:32:10 - trolljegeren: there is no pronoun or dove
27.4.2022, 03:32:24 - SlickRick: There was
27.4.2022, 03:32:34 - trolljegeren: no lol
27.4.2022, 03:32:41 - Scissortail: This is a lot of information that I don't see being verified 
27.4.2022, 03:32:47 - Scissortail: How do we know they are Interpol?
27.4.2022, 03:33:03 - SlickRick: Scissortail: He's a troll alt. Don't waste your time.
27.4.2022, 03:33:05 - trolljegeren: You don't but Interpol HQ is in Lyon, France
27.4.2022, 03:33:24 - trolljegeren: So at least I verified he spoke french in the other room I invited you
27.4.2022, 03:33:37 - trolljegeren: and he's definitely french
27.4.2022, 03:33:43 - SlickRick: Darlatan the friendly interpol agent / github maintainer had the same pronouns & dove emoji Lena when I looked. It's a Babba alt
27.4.2022, 03:33:55 - Scissortail: So you say, but anyone can say anything here.
27.4.2022, 03:34:04 - trolljegeren: Darlatan is a reference to the 3 musketeers
27.4.2022, 03:34:10 - trolljegeren: you're just an idiot
27.4.2022, 03:34:14 - Scissortail: I can verify personally with people if they are Interpol, because all Interpol agents are registered.
27.4.2022, 03:34:44 - trolljegeren: Scissortail: he won't give his name you know
27.4.2022, 03:34:45 - Scissortail: But on the flipside, you can't verify my ID because I can't give you that here or anywhere but in person.
27.4.2022, 03:34:53 - SlickRick: The darlatan github reference to cremation is gone as well now.
27.4.2022, 03:34:56 - grintea: <@fhgfnnj:matrix.org "This literally never happened."> nah bro i ask my doctor to communicate with internet strangers via sealed letter codewords all the time

27.4.2022, 03:41:10 - mydarkstar: Excuse me?
27.4.2022, 03:45:29 - trolljegeren: I verified he's a french speaker
27.4.2022, 03:47:28 - SlickRick: Wow he speaks french, like you? He's annoying, like you? He pops in, spams & then eventually disappears, probably like you will? Crazy, is he your brother?
27.4.2022, 04:05:34 - Muddy Coins: This is a crazy situation. I want someone who was a lead maintainer to fork and resume the work. This has been a distraction for long enough. 
27.4.2022, 04:06:00 - Muddy Coins: All of the chats has gone to shit. All noise. 
27.4.2022, 04:16:15 - Scissortail: I don't see anything concrete besides a photo allegedly containing AnonyPla in a hospital awaiting transfer
27.4.2022, 04:16:27 - Scissortail: That can't be verified, much like this "Interpol" agent
27.4.2022, 04:16:41 - Scissortail: And I am forced to operate under the assumption of this being an elaborate hoax.
27.4.2022, 04:18:09 - Scissortail: Finally: If that were true, that they were in hospital, about to die from a wound, you wouldn't have had access to a phone because you would be in a medically induced coma to reduce fatigue and facilitate healing.
27.4.2022, 04:19:38 - Scissortail: It's like nobody has any knowledge of the human body. If you are dying from a gunshot or flak injury, you will not be permitted to be up on social media like that. It does not work this way. They put you under for however long until your vitals return to healthy levels or you pass. Sorry, but that's reality.
27.4.2022, 04:21:23 - SlickRick: I'm happy to draw a line under it & just move on, I don't like typing spam bs in to these great chats, but the issue is more of these trolls & absurd stories. Ban me if you are going to keep this bs up because I refuse to just pretend it's not all lies.
27.4.2022, 04:21:58 - SlickRick: It's insulting to have this much BS you have to pretend makes sense
27.4.2022, 04:24:36 - SlickRick: The fact that the github interpol agent "Darlatan" removed the :dove: Lena & pronouns to me screams babba alt. He has 2 address it honestly.
27.4.2022, 04:27:07 - SlickRick: https://github.com/AnonyPla-ng/thgtoa/discussions/11 It's really disgusting to use these kinds of emotional ploys
27.4.2022, 04:27:44 - Scissortail: You can recover anything that was on git. Either way, I'll fork the project and maintain it myself if I have to. Someone has to.
27.4.2022, 04:28:19 - Scissortail: 18Fs stand with AnonyPla whether this is an attempt to clear their threat model or an elaborate prank.
27.4.2022, 04:28:52 - Scissortail: I like AP and what she did, whether that's the person maintaining the repo or someone else.
27.4.2022, 04:33:22 - Muddy Coins: Russian military are to blame for the site being taken down. Has the story continued to be changed?
27.4.2022, 04:42:09 - SlickRick: Well we just had Anonypla show back up, Babba verifies 100% its her, then Anonypla says some stuff like "Why were you guys mean to Darlatan, he is an interpol agent who saved me" in reference to an annoying person who was just like trolljegeren & refused to specify information.

Then someone finds a github account under the same name "Darlatan" that was created 10 days prior, and is now talking about fund raising for her cremation & taking over the guide.

Then the 100% verified authentic Anonypla deletes accounts & disappears.
27.4.2022, 04:42:29 - SlickRick: Then something about her actually being dead and passed some message before surgery to a nurse to give something to a trusted friend blah blah
27.4.2022, 04:43:29 - SlickRick: Even if that's true you still have to explain why you verified a fake anonypla  & modded them that claimed an interpol agent is now forking the guide & raising funds for a funeral
27.4.2022, 04:43:43 - Scissortail: Again, hearsay.
27.4.2022, 04:43:55 - Scissortail: Verify what you're saying or stop saying it like fact?
27.4.2022, 04:44:03 - Scissortail: I'm tired and this is exhausting enough.
27.4.2022, 04:44:48 - SlickRick: Babba verified 100% 'Anonypla"'s account, Anonypla then claimed Darlatan was an interpol agent who saved her, and Darlatan had created a github account 10 days earlier & fundraised for her cremation. Then it comes out & the 100% verified anonypla disappears.
27.4.2022, 04:44:51 - SlickRick: Those are facts.
27.4.2022, 04:45:49 - Scissortail: Where is this verified?
27.4.2022, 04:46:17 - SlickRick: Ask Babba.
27.4.2022, 04:46:20 - SlickRick: Or anyone who has been here.
27.4.2022, 04:52:50 - Scissortail: See, now you're telling me THEY verified it, and it's a cyclical issue.
27.4.2022, 04:53:14 - Scissortail: I now have to talk to person B to verify person A lol
27.4.2022, 04:53:25 - SlickRick: If that's to much effort for you maybe be quiet
27.4.2022, 04:53:36 - Scissortail: Guess what they're gonna do? Refer me to person C and so on.
27.4.2022, 04:54:05 - Scissortail: I'm being totally respectable here.
27.4.2022, 04:54:15 - SlickRick: So you have time to spam comments with doubt, but you don't have time to @ them and actually see what they say?
27.4.2022, 04:54:17 - SlickRick: Another weird troll
27.4.2022, 04:55:11 - Scissortail: If you know it's true, then you should be able to give me the truth yourself, you see what I'm saying?
27.4.2022, 04:55:18 - Scissortail: Why send someone on a goose chase?

27.4.2022, 04:57:32 - Scissortail: Nice logical fallacy, dude.
27.4.2022, 05:01:56 - Scissortail: Only thing verifiable here is that the Mastadon for AnonyPla says they were in danger of being doxxed.
27.4.2022, 05:02:19 - Scissortail: Which is true when you give more information to people that would seek to discredit you.

27.4.2022, 07:30:41 - SlickRick: Ok so before leaving DM Babba tells me that the Anonypla he verified as authentic only claimed our github faker interpol agent "Darlatan" was an interpol agent was because she heard rumors of it before. So then I ask how could this interpol agent have possibly found this matrix chat without direct information from her, as she directly claimed in the chat that he was an interpol agent and had saved her. So clearly she had to have told him about the chat for him to find it, right?

"I dunno, maybe through the guide which literally gives the link to her Matrix community. Maybe Darlatan had prior knowledge of the guide and the Matrix community before this all started. On a related note, I heard there's a flat Earth and creationist convention next week"

HAHA. Ok so our interpol friend was a part of the chat before his heroic efforts.

My word what a crock of BS. It's incredible how poorly thought out this all is.

27.4.2022, 07:50:50 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏è Lena): Even that's overkill, as you don't need to wipe an entire system to delete an identity
27.4.2022, 07:55:05 - @karlq:matrix.org: Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏è Lena): "Lena" Yes, say it a thousand times and you might just convince people that fake name is the author. Someone already made it clear the troops weren't NEAR Kyiv at the time they posted the Russians were close, add that to the laundry list of inconsistencies. "Everyone, here is a bunch of specific identifying information about me, it's definitely not false info as a part of this effort to increase my anonymity by killing this identity". 

And disappearing an identity takes 30seconds? Yeah, I do realise that, maybe you/they should've, too. It doesn't take a half-baked thriller novel with more holes in it than the Jussie Smollet story. Amazingly in the context of this room, being deeply skeptical of ridiculous stories is "flat earther". Go ahead ban me, like I want to participate in a chat where a pre-condition of your stay is to believe the dumb story you concoct. Maybe i'll come back as Farlatan, the friendly local Interpol agent / fundraiser. 

And did you mention why you verified "anonypla" as alive and yet in DM's were saying she's dead & the whole BS about handing a note to a nurse pre-surgery & she didn't survive.

So stupid it's amazing you thought it would stick.

29.4.2022, 16:46:59 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): it's perfectly accessible from Tor, requires no phone number
29.4.2022, 16:47:31 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): And GitHub will host your domain for free
29.4.2022, 16:47:34 - dml: i guess the concern is that to contribute, you'd need a github account, and for that you'd need an email address and maybe they enforce having a phone number?
29.4.2022, 16:47:44 - bober182: Registration is heavily limited over Tor, you need to bounce exit nodes until you get a working one.

29.4.2022, 16:50:02 - Trolljegeren (ad interim mod): (so that you do have an e-mail at least during the registration process and then you change it to whatever you want)
29.4.2022, 16:50:21 - dml: would be curious to know if they also require a phone number... anyone know offhand?

29.4.2022, 16:59:51 - anarkiocrypto: Github works for me in Tor Browser (both signup and editing files via the website). Maybe try OnionMail.org for email. If not, you could try Tor -> unblacklisted VPN in Whonix Workstation (protection via Tor's 3 hops but the website sees a VPN instead of Tor exit node).
29.4.2022, 17:03:39 - anarkiocrypto: Github doesn't require a phone number, but if you need one for e.g. Twitter, you can use SMSPVA.com, JuicySMS.com or TextVerified.com which accept Bitcoin/Monero. If you can still buy Visa/MasterCard gift cards for cash without ID where you live, you could use it with TextVerified. There are some free SMS verification websites (search "receive sms online free" in DuckDuckGo and try multiple pages) but they are often already used.

6.5.2022, 11:23:30 - Scissortail: There's an app that creates a small amount of vibration and noise (white noise) that defeats remote listening posts

6.5.2022, 11:25:31 - Scissortail: Yes, it effectively jams your device microphone so no other app can use it
6.5.2022, 11:26:10 - cyantrees: So can apps bypass the app permissions?
6.5.2022, 11:26:15 - cyantrees: Or why
6.5.2022, 11:26:33 - Scissortail: No other apps can use the mic when you do this

6.5.2022, 15:56:15 - Scissortail: It can also be defeated with the tool above that utilizes the mic on your cell phone, because it distorts the frequency

10.5.2022, 18:01:14 - Maple: Hey all! I'm hoping this is the right place to look for a recommendation.

For a project that I'm currently brainstorming on, I'm trying to figure out a mechanism to deliver "packages" of trivial file hierarchies to a user's desktop, in a decentralized and anonymous way.

These "packages", the way I'm imagining it, would be just a manifest with metadata and a list of files to pull, cryptographically signed.

Requirements:

* Needs to be libre software / open source from the ground up.
* Should be resistant to censorship (ie, no central repositories for files)
* As anonymous as possible (no one should know who you are, or associate multiple file downloads to the same source)
* Should at very least run on Linux, running on Windows is a benefit
* Any processes involved must be able to run with minimal privilege (ie, any non-admin user can run)

Nice to have:
* Written in relatively low level language (C, C++, Go, etc)
* Approachable as an API rather than a background process

I've looked at Zeronet (which seems to restricted to just serving websites), currently reading up on GNUnet (from the guide, seems to break the last requirement).
If all else fails, I could probably just wrap some tools around IPFS+Tor, but I'm hoping that a solution alredy exists with more eyes on it.

Any ideas what I could/should look at? :) Thanks!

15.5.2022, 00:25:59 - solonovamax: tbh, I would say that "typically, open source software is more secure than closed source software"
but that isn't always the case. Closed source software can very much have backdoors or exploits as well (there have been a few such cases where things like open source minecraft clients have had secret backdoors installed in them), but by the nature of them being open source, it just makes it easier to review it & look for said back doors

And especially for big open source projects, like the linux kernel, it has been independently audited many times, and many more eyes have looked at it, which makes it more secure than windows, which not as many people have looked over the code.
But, smaller open source projects are still just as vulnerable to security issues as anything else, someone else just might decide to spot it and responsibly report it

Wtf?!
19.5.2022, 12:07:02 - Sergey Mamadjanov: I think this is not exactly what is required so much :( If anyone wants to help, here is place with links to official aid sources for Ukraine https://stand-with-ukraine.pp.ua/
19.5.2022, 12:07:13 - Sergey Mamadjanov: Sorry for offtopic
19.5.2022, 12:49:18 - Tommy: üëÄ
19.5.2022, 16:08:52 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Before last week I had never heard of Cwtch, then I found an article on DDOSecrets that led to finding the Cwtch IM website. I dug around and checked the crypto and read the docs.
19.5.2022, 16:09:25 - qbw3ykpkzejp: The crypto is very strong, using libsodium to create profiles that are encrypted and deniable.
19.5.2022, 16:10:10 - qbw3ykpkzejp: The actual app is only vulnerable if an attacker has complete physical control of the disk, in which case, you can run it in a Android VM or Qubes OS to provide further protection against this.
19.5.2022, 16:11:08 - qbw3ykpkzejp: This way a client creates a decentralized profile, not requiring anything but Tor to signup for, like Briar.
19.5.2022, 16:12:01 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Session is still not formally recommended because it doesn't have some of the features like Perfect Forward Secrecy.
19.5.2022, 16:12:51 - qbw3ykpkzejp: https://docs.openprivacy.ca/cwtch-security-handbook/authentication_protocol.html - how the secret keys are derived.
19.5.2022, 16:13:06 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Once the session has ended, a transcript containing the long term and ephemeral public keys, a derived session key and all encrypted messages in the session cannot be proven to be authentic i.e. this protocol provides message & participant repudiation (offline deniable) in addition to message unlinkability (offline deniable) in the case where someone is satisfied that a single message in the transcript must have originated from a peer, there is no way of linking any other message to the session.
19.5.2022, 16:13:22 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Any standalone transcript is subject to forgery and thus cannot be used to cryptographically tie a peer to a conversation.
19.5.2022, 16:15:09 - qbw3ykpkzejp: https://doc.libsodium.org/secret-key_cryptography/secretstream - Libsodium (forked off of NaCL) - very well documented

19.5.2022, 16:24:14 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Session desktop uses their own network. Cwtch uses the Tor anonymity network as a framework to build upon with Tapir.
19.5.2022, 16:26:05 - qbw3ykpkzejp: It's essentially a fork of Ricochet IM but improved through stronger encryption stacks.
19.5.2022, 16:26:37 - qbw3ykpkzejp: And ricochet has been deprecated for a long time unlike Briar and Cwtch.

22.5.2022, 01:47:12 - qbw3ykpkzejp: But that's why you go from Tor to VPN if you need to
22.5.2022, 01:47:13 - xyhhx is still awake: You can be inspected by third parties
22.5.2022, 01:47:17 - xyhhx is still awake: but ye
22.5.2022, 01:47:30 - xyhhx is still awake: oh ok i see where you're going iwth it
22.5.2022, 01:47:31 - xyhhx is still awake: yeah
22.5.2022, 01:47:41 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Eliminate risk of using a VPN by connecting to Tor first
22.5.2022, 01:47:50 - qbw3ykpkzejp: But that's why it's controversial
22.5.2022, 01:48:24 - xh7r5t: i would never use a vpn for anything that should be anonymous, but for torrenting linux isos and doing OSINT i think they are a good resource even if they log
22.5.2022, 01:48:26 - qbw3ykpkzejp: Because you must hide your activity from your ISP by connecting a proxy and those are shit unless you use a VPN which gives you encryption which is also carried over to the Tor exit node
22.5.2022, 02:06:11 - qbw3ykpkzejp: There are probably VPNs that exist that do not log, but you can't shift the amount of trust you have for Tor over to VPN because anyone can claim (especially if it's a lie) they don't log anything. No threat model exists where the trust can shift from Tor to VPN. Tor itself is a VPN anyway, as any individual should realize.
22.5.2022, 02:54:14 - ÁÇÆÁÅ∞: <@amnesi:matrix.org "why"> Thanks for the advice, the reason I want to use vpn over tor over vpn is because I'm in a totalitarian country and they monitor traffic from tor and once I register an account with tor, within a few days the account will be blocked. So I want to use this method to solve this problem.

22.5.2022, 07:47:19 - qbw3ykpkzejp: I want to be clear that I removed my comments not because I was asked but because I wanted certain things to be known about attempts to remove the project; for Lena's connections to the privacy and cybersecurity world; and attempts to discredit her name because of the fact she gave over the keys to the project to someone you might not trust fully. But you shouldn't trust anybody. You should always question everything you read online. The entire fucking point was to create a medium where the topics can be discussed directly and where to start researching those topics. It's a starting point. It can be greater than it is. But it needed to be acknowledged that certain groups of people want to make it very difficult to publish this information. Even if it's just a collection of public information made easily accessible to the masses, it's still a very important resource for many, and that threatens the existence of certain groups that are paid to (and enjoy) making it impossible to be anonymous, safe, transparent and secure.

22.5.2022, 21:47:11 - gi4cxw9etepc: Guys there is some creepy rumor. It is like: NSA add you watchlist if you use Telegram, use Tor, use linux something like that. Edward Snowden says like this if I remember correctly. Care to elobrate?
22.5.2022, 21:50:17 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏è Lena): Basically, watchlists are an excuse for governments to track you. It's a lot easier to justify to an oversight committee when you're tracking someone who's given a reason they should be tracked, even if the reason is complete bullshit
22.5.2022, 21:51:18 - gi4cxw9etepc: it is not governments, it is just American NSA
22.5.2022, 21:51:32 - gi4cxw9etepc: not other governments like American survelliance

22.5.2022, 21:52:52 - Babba27's Evil Twin (DriftNotSkid) [they|them] (üïäÔ∏è Lena): Watchlists are also a great way of prioritizing who you spy on. It's like a categorization method for who's worth your time

Do you express liberal beliefs? You're on a watchlist. Do you express conservative beliefs? You're also on a watchlist.

23.5.2022, 23:53:13 - boberts29292992: at first I thought he was a normal guy because he dmed me about how secure are iphones

24.5.2022, 00:16:42 - @qbw3ykpkzejp:magdeburg.jetzt: It's better than the bible. You can fit the entire DNM bible in it in, but that would make the guide as it is, outdated, just by including it

Make a Github pages repo (or better, Codeberg pages seems more censorship-resistant: https://codeberg.page/) and you can host index.html, guide.html, about.html for free. AFAIK you can easily convert Markdown -> HTML. You also get a free website.github.io or website.codeberg.page subdomain. If you want a paid server, 1984.is, Privex.io or Njal.la offer anonymous hosting for Bitcoin/Monero.

2.6.2022, 03:26:36 - antisec-: I know how to do the website build and the repo has its own build automation for continuous deployment
so maybe gh-pages won't be so bad for it 
eventually the original website will be down because the domain will expire
then I can either buy it or use a similar one
I don't think I'm going to use the signatures for it, though, the minisign especially
